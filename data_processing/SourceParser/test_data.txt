An Art Lens System unlike any other; it offers you all the freedom of a zoom lens without compromising on prime lens quality, and it’s the only convertible Art Lens out there to work with a range of modern-day analogue and digital cameras.

Sure, one answer is laziness. But it\'s actually more interesting than that, involving what kind of cart user you are and how your motivation aligns with two general categories of social norms. You may be someone who always returns the cart, never returns it, only does so if it\'s convenience, feels pressure to return it from either a cart attendant or someone waiting to park in the spot where your cart is parked, you have children and they get a kick out of returning it. From Krystal D\'Costa\'s "<a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/anthropology-in-practice/why-dont-people-return-their-shopping-carts/">Anthropology in Practice</a>" column in Scientific American:\n\n\n\n<blockquote><P>\nSocial norms fall into two general categories. There are injunctive norms, which drive our responses based on our perception of how others will interpret our actions. This means that we\'re inclined to act in certain ways if we think people will think well or think poorly of us. And there are descriptive norms, where our responses are driven by contextual clues. This means we\'re apt to mimic behaviors of others—so what we see or hear or smell suggests the appropriate/accepted response or behavior that we should display.<P>\n\nSupermarkets can try and guide our behavior with receptacles or cart attendants, but they’re competing with our own self-serving goals, which in this case may be staying dry, keeping an eye on our children, or simply getting home as quickly as possible, and we’re being guided by the ways others behave on top of that. These goals can override the norm because the support provided by the supermarket—ironically—resets the situation before complete chaos is unleashed with carts running rampant in the parking lot. An attendant will most likely step in before that happens. So if we apply this definition of norms to our classification of cart returners, the injunctive norm applies the greatest pressure to Returners and Pressure Returners. These folks are concerned by what others will think of them on some level, and want to adhere to social rule mandating that the carts are returned. Descriptive norms are at play for Convenience Returners and Pressure Returners who are more inclined to act if there is precedent. These folks are more likely to return a cart if there are no carts parked haphazardly. The Never Returners and the Child-Driven Returners are two example of goal-driven actors, which means that they’re responding to a more individual need. These two are interesting as they’re on opposing ends of the spectrum but still demonstrate the ways an individual goal can work for or against a norm....\n<P>\nAs a situation broaches on deviance, more people will trend toward disorder; once we have permission to pursue an alternative action, we will do so if it suits us. Not returning our shopping carts opens the door to throwing our circulars on the ground to parking haphazardly or in reserved spaces to other items that impact the quality of our experience at that establishment.</blockquote>\n<P>\n<a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/anthropology-in-practice/why-dont-people-return-their-shopping-carts/">Why Don\'t People Return Their Shopping Carts?</a> <em>(SciAm)</em>\n\n<P>\n<small>\n<em>(photo: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/drb62/4273903651/in/photolist-7vESDZ-5Xf7zZ-6eg9tm-bnoHtv-dSTVZG-3YPZ1-9gPrNN-8DrDLy-aPAg36-4xcT4w-dkbapS-nkT8VY-pdFxfj-nkQT5P-31nE5b-TckgPq-pzMLQr-8fwuHG-fE9tBN-axAjTU-9Po81d-9wrrek-mu9xyR-635B69-nDkbgM-aZwuDz-83dsqR-ccQDM-8SDZo1-2avSAw-ovXhNA-3752co-q8gdn3-6YyqQf-dizSV2-6gy2Nf-9NYGWp-nY8SwA-4cpJwh-qSut3t-8P1xxM-aXYbVD-dSNty6-4MAMQ1-TojZMy-az9vq2-58KuKM-bvFyMd-6E199-qoop">Daniel Blume/Flickr</a>)</em></small><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~4/fyfKJHUWjTY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}, {'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/boingboing/ibag', 'value': '<p><img width="587" height="391" src="http://boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/screenshot-4.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/screenshot-4.jpg?w=587 587w, https://i2.wp.com/boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/screenshot-4.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" /></p><P>\nWhy do so many people just leave their shopping carts in the parking lot after unloading groceries instead of rolling them to the receptacles?

Which is great, because listening to her talk about it on <em>Graham Norton</em> is the best for us.</p>\n<p>Armed with a glass of wine, Keaton extolled the benefits of movie smooches to the audience and her fellow guests. "Think of all the men you get to kiss, and you don\'t pay the price," she said. Then, as a natural next step, she kissed Graham Norton, Kevin Bacon, and Jessica Chastain.&#160;</p>\n<p>The takeaway from all of this, of course, is that Diane Keaton is a national treasure and should be on every episode of every talk show.

Unfortunately, these stats aren\'t as shocking as they should be.</p>\n<p>Because there are so few of these leaders, some women may feel like they have to compete with each other for one of the top spots. But instead of competing against each other, women can work together to break that mold. &#160;&#160;&#160;</p>\n<p>Mentors can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2352144/" rel="nofollow">have a positive impact</a> on the attitudes of those they\'ve taken under their wing, encouraging them to achieve big things. This could be extremely helpful for women trying to make it in male-dominated fields. It\'s sometimes an uphill battle, and having someone on your side that provides a boost of confidence can be a real game-changer. &#160;&#160; <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/05/05/women-helping-women-in-business/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&amp;utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial">Read more...</a></p>More about <a href="http://mashable.com/category/supported/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&amp;utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial">Supported</a> and <a href="http://mashable.com/business/?utm_campaign=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&amp;utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial">Business</a><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Mashable/~4/8E7OcoCCSzg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': None, 'enclosures': None}

Our challenge to the companies is to build on this progress and become high-level innovators, while delivering more for less. Involving third parties in the projects will help network companies take this next step,” he added.</p>\n<h2>Looking out for a new energy grid</h2>\n<p>The LCNF provided $750 million over the six years to companies large and small that were developing innovative solutions for the energy grid.</p>\n<p>“It is important that companies take this opportunity.

Then, as your autonomous vehicle chauffeurs you to the venue, the streetlights lining the road form a cocoon around you, turning on as you approach and turning off soon after you pass. City-sponsored drones zip around overhead, looking out for any traffic bottlenecks that might impact your journey.</p>\n<p>Then, when you pull up to the municipal garage outside the arena, a kiosk tells you exactly where the nearest vacant parking spot is, making the experience a stress-free breeze.</p>\n<p>This is just a small sampling of what life will be like in a smart city. But even in this simple example, several key details went into creating the smooth experience. Among them: The streetlights must respond to the presence of a vehicle, the drones flying overhead must know how to identify and report traffic patterns, the municipal parking lot must be able to track each spot’s occupancy, and so forth.</p>\n<h2>Coordination is key</h2>\n<p>Too often, city departments dive headfirst into the realm of connected technology without coordinating their efforts. For example, the utilities department will deploy one network for its smart meters, while the department of transportation uses a different one for its energy-efficient streetlights. Ultimately, this results in a variety of compatibility issues that leave cities with headaches and high costs.</p>\n<p>On top of that, with this uncoordinated approach, key day-to-day data ends up siloed off within departments. This makes it difficult for city leaders to fully capitalize on the treasure trove of insights made possible by the IoT. Unnecessary resources must be devoted to connect this siloed information, which results in a slower analysis process and could lead to accuracy issues.</p>\n<p>Also, due to the fact that <a class="editor-link editor_tip" title="" href="http://www.techsling.com/2016/02/future-proof-tech-focusing-network-longevity/">network longevity</a> concerns have plagued the IoT throughout its existence, a city utilizing more networks than necessary is only making things more difficult (and costly) for itself <a class="editor-link editor_tip" title="" href="http://www.smartdatacollective.com/john-horn/354025/why-fall-2g-could-be-disastrous-businesses">once the next sunset</a> comes around. Therefore, city departments must work in tandem when deploying IoT technologies, keep network longevity in mind, and strive to keep things as streamlined as possible.</p>\n<h2>The perks of a cohesive Smart City</h2>\n<p>When properly built, smart cities reap countless benefits that include:</p>\n<p><b>1. Sustainability</b><b>.</b> Cities that embrace IoT technology can <a class="editor-link editor_tip" title="" href="https://www.ceps.eu/system/files/iecWP-smartcities-LR-en.pdf">optimize their use of resources</a>, including water, fuel, energy, and even waste. The city of Los Angeles, for example, <a class="editor-link editor_tip" title="" href="http://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/Los-Angeles-Deploying-Smart-Streetlight-Network.html">installed LED bulbs</a> in its streetlights and successfully cut its energy use by 60 percent. The Dutch city of Eindhoven took things even further by <a class="editor-link editor_tip" title="" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-smart-lighting-systems-cities">installing streetlights</a> similar to the ones I described earlier — they turn on and off depending on how busy the street is.</p>\n<p>Aside from saving the environment, smart cities save big bucks thanks to their IoT initiatives. Los Angeles’ LED bulbs save the city <a class="editor-link editor_tip" title="" href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/10/technology/l-a-lights/">$8 million per year</a>, and the city of Barcelona <a class="editor-link editor_tip" title="" href="https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-072X-14-3">saved more than 75 million euros</a> in 2014 by adopting IoT-driven smart water, lighting, and more.</p>\n<p><b>2. Community</b><b>. </b>A city that illustrates a commitment to improvement through smart initiatives is more likely to build strong, well-informed, and healthy communities.</p>\n<p>For example, by creating <a class="editor-link editor_tip" title="" href="http://smartcity.bcn.cat/en/barcelona-wi-fi.html">an autonomous smart bus network</a> and offering free citywide Wi-Fi, Barcelona has effectively encouraged its residents to drive less, walk more, and get out and explore the area. As a result, pollution levels have decreased, <a class="editor-link editor_tip" title="" href="http://www.barcinno.com/if-smart-cities-had-iqs-barcelona-would-be-a-genius/">obesity rates have dropped,</a> and residents feel engaged with their hometown.</p>\n<p>In America, Atlantic City, N.J., is embracing smart technology by installing LED streetlights that feature <a class="editor-link editor_tip" title="" href="http://www.ledinside.com/news/2016/6/atlantic_city_intelligent_streetlights_keep_pedestrians_connected_and_fully_powered">charging stations</a> and display screens that keep citizens informed of current events and emergency announcements.</p>\n<p><b>3. Growth</b><b>. </b>Smart cities don’t just save municipalities money and improve the lives of current residents; they also attract new residents. Who wouldn’t want to live and work in a city with great air quality, low utility costs, reliable public transit, and free-flowing Wi-Fi?</p>\n<p>Businesses in particular flock to cities that take care of their smart infrastructure because it lowers operating costs. <a class="editor-link editor_tip" title="" href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=EI244369">One study predicts</a> the global business community will spend more than <a class="editor-link editor_tip" title="" href="http://www.jll.com/GSP/global-sustainability/smart-buildings">$18 billion</a> incorporating smart technology into buildings in 2017 — which far surpasses the $5.5 billion it spent back in 2012.</p>\n<p>The energy savings in smart buildings make the move worthwhile, typically <a class="editor-link editor_tip" title="" href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-business-case-for-smart-building-technology">paying for itself</a> on an enterprise level within a year or two. Smart windows alone can <a class="editor-link editor_tip" title="" href="http://www.rcrwireless.com/20160725/business/energy-costs-smart-building-tag31-tag99">save up to 26 percent</a> on cooling and 67 percent on lighting costs.</p>\n<p>In order for a smart city to truly bring its <a class="editor-link editor_tip" title="" href="http://readwrite.com/2016/10/04/ingenu-offers-new-program-for-creating-smart-cities-cl4/">IoT-driven features</a> to life and see long-term value in its investment, it must create a cohesive and holistic smart infrastructure. Every department must be involved and understand how IoT-driven solutions can benefit them, and they must work together to create a seamless, streamlined experience that optimizes life for its current (and future) residents.</p>\n<p>When smart cities operate in harmony, their citizens, industries, and environments all thrive.</p>\n<p><i>John Horn joined </i><i><a class="editor-link editor_tip" title="" href="http://www.ingenu.com/">Ingenu</a> </i><i>after serving as president of RacoWireless, a leading provider of machine-to-machine (M2M) connectivity solutions.

Inside the module is an alarm, which goes off when a dangerous electrical arc happens.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The rise Internet of Things was an opportunity for us. Affordable modules and network fees allow vendors like us to create more sophisticated systems cheaply,&#8221; said CEO Choi Seoung Wook, the founder of Nare IoT Labs.</p>\n<h2>Started with farm security cameras</h2>\n<p>Choi has previously built security cameras for farmers to spot robbers and report them to the police, a crime that was become more commonplace in South Korea.

As drivers contemplate letting computers take over control of the wheel for them, it brings up some important questions. What will cars of the future look like? What things will drivers be able to accomplish on their rides to work? And most importantly, what cool features will they be able to enjoy now that their attention doesn’t have to be on the road?</p>\n<h2>1. No parking skills? No need to fret</h2>\n<p>Parking sucks, especially the dreaded parallel. It&#8217;s often tricky in congested areas, it sometimes leads to smashed alloy wheels and it&#8217;s deeply embarrassing when not done correctly, which is why most are happy to hand over valet duties to a robot. Ford, Renault and many premium brands already own a system that will hunt down parallel and reverse parking spots and then use sensors and cameras to correctly steer the vehicle into the space, only calling upon a human for throttle inputs.</p>\n<p>But things are about to get a whole lot easier, as BMW and Mercedes-Benz now boast tech that simply requires a prod of a smartphone for perfect parking results. BMW&#8217;s Remote Control Parking is already on the 7 Series \xa0&#8212; \xa0and due to be rolled out on more models next year &#8212; and sees the car autonomously reverse into and pull out of spaces, while Mercedes&#8217; Remote Parking Pilot does a similar thing but also caters for perpendicular parking. The latter will appear on the new E-Class, which is due out late this year or early 2017.</p>\n<h2>2. Connected from the road to the kitchen</h2>\n<p>When your car knows to open the garage door and turn the AC on as you head down the road, you know you’ve hit peak connectivity. The ease of access for drivers as cars become a tool to become your personal assistant is rapidly advancing. The latest multimedia systems allow for emails to be read and sent, hands-free calls to be made and Twitter to be updated on the move by some of the largest car manufacturers like Nissan. Some even know to power themselves!</p>\n<p>The cars of the future will be an extension of your home. As the auto industry combines to meld with the IoT revolution, we’ll see connectivity that we’ve never had before. Wouldn’t it be great to record your favorite television show when you’re running late by communicating with your vehicle? The cars of the future and you will end up being quite the team. Can’t wait or don’t want to buy a new car? Adapters from companies like Autobrain, Automatic and Vinli will turn your car (as long as it&#8217;s built after 1996) into the 4G connected, Wi-Fi enabled, connected car of the future.</p>\n<h2>3. A mobile living room</h2>\n<p>When car owners are no longer required to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel because computers are in the driver’s seat, the journey will be just as important as the destination. To the discerning 21 century mediaphile, this means HD screens, on-demand content streaming and one-kick ass, next-generation audio system to experience it with, just like one might in their living room but with the bonus of a smaller space and killer surround sound. Companies such as Auro-3D have partnered with companies like Porsche to introduce three-dimensional spatial sound patterns that replicate real-life sound experiences that are reminiscent of the best concert halls, but all in the comfort of your own car. This set up delivers the best-possible music playback to make every trip a new driving experience, not just a ride.</p>\n<h2>4. Goodbye dials, hello gestures</h2>\n<p>Why touch, when you can wave? Rear-view mirrors, radios, and more are moving away from the antiquated dial system to understand hand gestures through infrared cameras. Touch screens are increasingly becoming the easiest way to communicate with your vehicle over fumbling with dial switches. But the cars of the futures don’t want to have you even deal with potential smudges to that chrome finish. Thanks to leadership from Audi and Volvo, in efforts to de-clutter the dashboard to make you safer and more efficient, we’re going to see even touch screens get the boot as swipes and gestures will be the simplest and safest way to control functionality. Wave goodbye to those dials.</p>\n<h2>5. Never lose your keys again</h2>\n<p>We’ve seen in recent years the shift from key to keyless entry but next-generation cars take this one step further by completely removing them altogether. In the future, drivers will be able to unlock and start their cars using a fingerprint, retina scan or voice activation—similarly to how we access our smartphones today. And with how much time drivers save by not tearing the house apart looking for lost keys, they might be able to finish that book or learn a new language—or not. Plus, you’ll never have to worry about your teenager taking your car out without permission ever again. “Open the driver door, Tesla!” “I’m sorry Dave, I can’t do that.”</p>\n<p>With all the cool new car technology on the horizon, it’s enough to make anyone want to give up public transit to commute in bumper-to-bumper traffic to catch up on shows, listen to the hottest new album release or just hang out with friends.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://readwrite.com/2016/12/13/5-futuristic-car-technologies-that-are-available-now-or-heading-your-way-tl1/">5 futuristic connected car technologies that are here now &#8212; or will be soon</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://readwrite.com">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n<div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=tgSIlHOZaZ8:Fe58bB03eQI:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=tgSIlHOZaZ8:Fe58bB03eQI:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=tgSIlHOZaZ8:Fe58bB03eQI:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=tgSIlHOZaZ8:Fe58bB03eQI:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=tgSIlHOZaZ8:Fe58bB03eQI:Ij26kaj3iuU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=tgSIlHOZaZ8:Fe58bB03eQI:C2pbw5bZMiI"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=tgSIlHOZaZ8:Fe58bB03eQI:HaYztYP2wyo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=tgSIlHOZaZ8:Fe58bB03eQI:fvyXWMd9xfE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=tgSIlHOZaZ8:Fe58bB03eQI:OqabYuBsmOY"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/tgSIlHOZaZ8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': None, 'enclosures': None}

So it is no wonder that what are coming next in the tech world are wearables that read exactly what is going on in a person’s emotional health, not just physical, and align it with what is going on in the individual’s life.</p>\n<p>One way to look at what is in store for sensing emotions is to break it down into analysis and algorithms, input and output in the form of apps. Some innovations have already been looked at, like temporary tech tattoos that can read facial expressions, but there is more interest in practical emotion sensing gadgets that could easily go mainstream and assist in monitoring mental health.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Jawbone and Basis have previously used GSR technology in their wearables to determine perspiration levels and heart rate, but I believe that its potential hasn&#8217;t been fully explored yet. I continue to believe that next year Fitbit and other major players in the wearables space will start expanding the capabilities of their device by adding additional sensors,&#8221; says Jijiashvili.</p>\n<p>Several million users have been added to the mobile app, Headspace, over the past few months.\xa0 Several others have started using manual mood-watching Apple Watch apps, such as Thriveport. Pebble is a company that has users enter their mood levels throughout the day via its Happiness app. However, the fate of the Pebble Happiness study is in questions, after the Fitbit buyout. Apparently, Fitbit is interested in the software, and it might just show up in future Fitbit trackers.<br />\n<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5u45-x0-zoY" width="600" height="480" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>\n<h2>How emotion tracking works</h2>\n<p>The most difficult parts of emotion tracking are the <a href="https://www.wareable.com/health-and-wellbeing/future-of-emotion-sensing-wearables-111">algorithms behind how biometric sensors</a> and manual mood diaries work to provide insights given based on breathing and changing lifestyle habits. Any company focused on this will probably not be interested in sharing their algorithms, but a couple of companies such as Vinaya and its upcoming Zenta, along with the makers of the Feel wristband, have discussed the basics of their science.</p>\n<p>Zenta is a biometric bracelet that measures galvanic skin response, along with heart rate and heart rate variability, and combines this with a person’s digital life &#8212; calendar, social media &#8212; to construct a picture of his or her emotional life.\xa0 Vinaya&#8217;s algorithms match physiological signals to emotions like affection, anger and melancholy based on an academic model.</p>\n<p>&#8220;What technology can enable us to do today is truly amazing. But as we let our devices and virtual realities distract us from the present and negatively impact our wellbeing, we should recognize that this is an unbalanced relationship,&#8221; says Kate Unsworth, Vinaya&#8217;s co-founder. &#8220;We&#8217;ve built a lab in London, where our team conducts research and experiments into things like stress, anxiety, sleep, happiness, peace and fulfillment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are some other pretty interesting things being offered in this new world of mental health tracking.\xa0 Intel and British-Cypriot fashion designer, Hussein Chalayan, have collaborated to turn emotions into art. They use brainwaves, heart rate and breathing tracking &#8220;smart glasses&#8221; to gather data on emotions such as nerves, stress and attraction. Then they analyze them and turn them into videos. In each case, the visualizations change as respiration or heart rates change in real time. \xa0This project will be featured in the Design Museum in London until April.</p>\n<p>It looks as though 2017 is set to be a big year for wearable tech that focuses more on our mental health. Monitoring health can play a big part in preventing many diseases. Our emotional wellbeing is critical, and the tech world is noticing.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://readwrite.com/2016/12/13/mental-health-is-the-new-big-focus-for-the-tech-world-hl4/">Tech world aims to tackle the mental health issue next</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://readwrite.com">ReadWrite</a>.</p>\n<div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=fRxSLwrtghI:Ts-aCovtKjE:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=fRxSLwrtghI:Ts-aCovtKjE:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?i=fRxSLwrtghI:Ts-aCovtKjE:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=fRxSLwrtghI:Ts-aCovtKjE:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=fRxSLwrtghI:Ts-aCovtKjE:Ij26kaj3iuU"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=Ij26kaj3iuU" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=fRxSLwrtghI:Ts-aCovtKjE:C2pbw5bZMiI"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=C2pbw5bZMiI" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=fRxSLwrtghI:Ts-aCovtKjE:HaYztYP2wyo"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=HaYztYP2wyo" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=fRxSLwrtghI:Ts-aCovtKjE:fvyXWMd9xfE"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=fvyXWMd9xfE" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?a=fRxSLwrtghI:Ts-aCovtKjE:OqabYuBsmOY"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/readwriteweb?d=OqabYuBsmOY" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/readwriteweb/~4/fRxSLwrtghI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': None, 'enclosures': None}

The high tech, multi-line, digitally switched telephone of the late 1980s\u200a—\u200athe kind of phone upon which you could conduct, merge, and manage multiple direct conversations with your peers, colleagues, partners and adversaries\u200a—\u200aa direct line of human expression brain to brain\u200a—\u200athe kind of shit it’ll take us decades to replicate (if we ever do).</p>\n<p>Why was that phone so perfect? It certainly wasn’t the technology, though it was pretty darn boss at the time. It was how our society adapted to it, optimizing direct, one-to-one communications in real time between a network of engaged colleagues. As a young reporter, and later as an editor and a CEO, my call list was my life. I’d spend hours a day calling sources, collaborators, even employees down the hall\u200a—\u200aand as a result, we’d Get Shit Done.*</p>\n<p>Because to Get Shit Done, you have to engage real time with the people who help define what it is You Are Actually Doing. And nothing, nothing at all, beats a conversation to move that ball along.</p>\n<p>For reasons I am sure will merit multiple PhD defenses some day, we’ve evolved to an almost apologetic relationship to the humble telephone. Through email or social media (ick!), we ask each other for a “quick call”\u200a—\u200athen we offload the rest to calendar apps with their annoying reminders\u200a—\u200ashitty simulacrums of our intent which pervert our goal: to connect and exchange, to respond and to act.</p>\n<p>But first, always to connect.</p>\n<p>At some point in the last ten years we replaced direct connection with technology-intermediated obsequity. And when we do “get on a call,” it’s fraught with a Moderator and an Agenda and Follow Up Action Items and … well, wait what the f*ck are we talking about?</p>\n<p>No more. It’s time to pick up the phone and start calling each other again.</p>\n<p><em>Hey\u200a—\u200aIt’s John. You have a few minutes to bounce something around? Cool!…</em></p>\n<p><em>*Some industries continue to work this way\u200a—\u200aI’d love your input on which one you think still do.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/2017/04/pick-up-the-phone-and-call.php">Pick Up the Phone and Call.</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://battellemedia.com">John Battelle&#039;s Search Blog</a>.</p>\n<div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=lJSr91Gr-Kc:-hRg8_-o8Fk:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=lJSr91Gr-Kc:-hRg8_-o8Fk:D7DqB2pKExk"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?i=lJSr91Gr-Kc:-hRg8_-o8Fk:D7DqB2pKExk" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=lJSr91Gr-Kc:-hRg8_-o8Fk:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=lJSr91Gr-Kc:-hRg8_-o8Fk:-BTjWOF_DHI"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?i=lJSr91Gr-Kc:-hRg8_-o8Fk:-BTjWOF_DHI" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=lJSr91Gr-Kc:-hRg8_-o8Fk:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?i=lJSr91Gr-Kc:-hRg8_-o8Fk:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JohnBattellesSearchblog/~4/lJSr91Gr-Kc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': None, 'enclosures': None}

Now, well…YouTube. And Play. Twitter had similar reluctancies, and now…the NFL (oh, and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://twitter.com/twittersports" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://twitter.com/twittersports">college softball</a>!). Microsoft tried, but ultimately failed, to be a media company (there’s a reason it’s called <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">MS</strong>NBC), and had the sense to retreat from “social media” into “enterprise tools” so as to not beg confusion. Then again, it just bought LinkedIn, so the debate will most certainly flare up (wait, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">is</em> LinkedIn a media company?!).</p>\n<p class="graf graf--p">Truth is, with all these platform players, media is not only a crucial product, it’s the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">primary</em> product. I’m not going to get into why in this post (I will next time, promise.) Instead I’ll predict that quite soon, platforms, including Facebook, will lose their equivocation and embrace content creation.</p>\n<p class="graf graf--p">In the meantime, let’s talk about cute toddlers, shall we?</p>\n<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZCYHjc64Cv8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p class="graf graf--p"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.facebook.com/FOX13TampaBay/videos/vb.159207208524/500812630042841/?type=2&amp;theater" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/FOX13TampaBay/videos/vb.159207208524/500812630042841/?type=2&amp;theater">Here’s a video of two cute toddlers</a> practicing for a future as nightclub promoters (or WWF entertainers, it’s hard to decide). It’s been watched nearly 70 million times on Facebook. In one day.</p>\n<p class="graf graf--p">Did you read that right? Yep. 70 million times. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">In one day</em>.</p>\n<p class="graf graf--p">The video is two minutes long. Scores of “traditional” media outlets have <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://news.google.com/news/story?ncl=dTlsS6OimNveCYMduUhykqRBGIZXM&amp;q=all+night+toddler+party&amp;lr=English&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiu7Mb5pejSAhUE0GMKHaqHAoYQqgIIJjAA" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://news.google.com/news/story?ncl=dTlsS6OimNveCYMduUhykqRBGIZXM&amp;q=all+night+toddler+party&amp;lr=English&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiu7Mb5pejSAhUE0GMKHaqHAoYQqgIIJjAA">somehow gotten access to the video</a>, chroming it up with their own logos, music, and advertising. But the thing went viral on Facebook, and it’s Facebook that insured the kids got their 140 million minutes of fame (and counting).</p>\n<p class="graf graf--p">Here’s the thing. There are literally dozens, if not thousands, of these kinds of media objects on Facebook <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">every day</em>. Sure, maybe they’re not all 70-million-views-in-one-day big, but nevertheless, they’re media gold. They spread all over Facebook, all day long, but what drives me crazy is there’s no way to find them reliably. There’s no media product on Facebook that curates these gems, there’s only media distribution. And as everyone in the Valley (and in media) will tell you, Product Matters.</p>\n<p class="graf graf--p">So it’s time for Facebook to start making good media products. I mean, who wouldn’t want to visit a “Facebook trending viral videos” product at least once a day? Right? Search for viral videos on Facebook now, and you get dreck like <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.facebook.com/viral.videos.nr1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/viral.videos.nr1/">this</a>. I don’t know what angle these jokers’ are playing (I mean, there’s no ads there…), but it ain’t what Facebook, with their inside knowledge of what makes stuff go viral, could create.</p>\n<p class="graf graf--p">Sure, there are a ton of “media” players trying to find a way to make a living on Facebook\u200a—\u200aand the entire media world is now fretting over how dependent they’ve become on the attention black hole Facebook’s become. But the truth is, only Facebook knows what’s really happening behind that 2 billion person curtain. Anyone else making shit for Facebook is running with cement in their shoes.</p>\n<p class="graf graf--p">Facebook will never open up its ecosystem and let a million media flowers bloom. And the “media experience” on the site blows. Soon enough, they’ll have to fix it. It’s time for them to get on with it.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/2017/03/its-time-for-facebook-to-start-making-media.php">It&#8217;s Time For Facebook to Start Making Media</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://battellemedia.com">John Battelle&#039;s Search Blog</a>.</p>\n<div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=1hoq512BMM0:D59ujN7rT48:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=1hoq512BMM0:D59ujN7rT48:D7DqB2pKExk"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?i=1hoq512BMM0:D59ujN7rT48:D7DqB2pKExk" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=1hoq512BMM0:D59ujN7rT48:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=1hoq512BMM0:D59ujN7rT48:-BTjWOF_DHI"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?i=1hoq512BMM0:D59ujN7rT48:-BTjWOF_DHI" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=1hoq512BMM0:D59ujN7rT48:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?i=1hoq512BMM0:D59ujN7rT48:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JohnBattellesSearchblog/~4/1hoq512BMM0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': None, 'enclosures': None}

It’s been channeled into a few oligarchic platforms which have, through no obvious, direct, or apparently malicious intent of their own, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-drink-your-milkshake" target="_blank" data-href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-drink-your-milkshake">drunk our fucking milkshakes</a>.</span> The rest of us (and there are MILLIONS of us, and we are MIGHTY, if we decide to be), well the rest of us are left fighting over a shrinking pie, building extraordinary technology which we have increasingly bent toward the gray.</p>\n<p id="80f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I know, I know, it’s fashionable to blame Google, Facebook*, and their ilk for siphoning off all the advertising dollars publishers used to get, but I’m not going to. They simply did what conditions allowed them to do, which is create a welcoming place for advertisers who were feeling a bit unloved by the vast, bleached coral reef that is the open web. They identified a need, and they filled it. They built impressive, scaled, data-driven advertising machines. They won.</p>\n<p id="8fd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But what they failed to win was the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Gazetteer</em> portion of the equation. The CONTENT. Thanks in large part to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_harbor_%28law%29" target="_blank" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_harbor_%28law%29">Safe Harbor</a> syndrome (I just made that up, please hashtag that shit and make it a thing), these platforms disavowed any responsibility for the content that pulsed through their systems, the very content written by us millions, the very lifeblood of our Republic. They were never <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">publishers</em>, after all, nor were they media companies. No no, they were <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">platforms</em>, neutral to the core, bloodless algorithms matching a reader’s intent to a publisher’s content, nothing to see here, move along, just providing a service and taking our small tax along the way&#8230;</p>\n<p id="ddae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And that was kind of true, in the beginning, anyway. Back when Google was young, blogging was a thing, and the web shone brightly in its Golden Age. The great Search Engine That Won ruled as a benign monarch, impassively distributing intent like oxygenated water across the kelp beds of web publishing. For a brief, wonderful moment, it all Worked.</p>\n<p id="f3c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I won’t go into why it broke down (that’s <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://medium.com/@johnbattelle/blogging-meet-medium-please-procreate-aa2776b3ebfb#.6tp5oujbr" target="_blank" data-href="https://medium.com/@johnbattelle/blogging-meet-medium-please-procreate-aa2776b3ebfb#.6tp5oujbr">another essay</a>), but I do want to take a look at why it <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">worked</em>. Because perhaps there are some lessons to be learned as we look to the future of Internet publishing. (And yes, I do think publishing has a future on the Internet\u200a—\u200awe must tell stories. We must converse, we must because that is who we are, at such a deep level I can’t even fathom an argument about it.)</p>\n<p id="7163" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So what worked? Here’s my list, add to it as you will (that’s why there are comments, after all):</p>\n<ul class="postList">\n<li id="0980" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Open Links. An open economy of links allows authors and publishers to create a gift economy that sends attention and influence from one place to another. Of course, the open link economy is subject to fraud, abuse, rent extraction, and corruption.</li>\n<li id="c983" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Trackbacks. Built on open links, trackbacks allow publishers to know who’s gifting who. They’re a critical social proof in an attention economy. In another essay, I called them “meaningful handshakes from one mind to another.” Knowing who was linking to your stuff was deeply important to trace-route the social fabric of your community. Of course, trackbacks failed because spam (see above).</li>\n<li id="c723" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Analytics. Early web publishers had access to meaningful signals of how readers engaged with their content. Of course, once you’re publishing on someone else’s platform, the meaningful signals are reserved for the platform, not for the content creator.</li>\n<li id="8160" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Comments. I know, I know. But before comment spam and the rise of troll culture, comments Really Fucking Mattered. <span class="markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="a7aa408c8287">Medium has brought comments back in a meaningful way through Responses. Thank you.</span></li>\n<li id="5800" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Advertising. I’m sorry, but <span class="markup--quote markup--li-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="11bebab28a">advertising really does matter, in that it encourages small publications with ardent and meaningful audiences to continue doing what they were doing, which is inform, connect, and inspire communities of people</span>. What broke with advertising was its disconnection from community, just as with publishers. Sure, you can buy audience all day long. But without context? C’mon.</li>\n<li id="32b5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">And and and&#8230; There are more, but I want to get to my conclusion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p id="7fd8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Here’s my point: One by one, we lost what was Good about the early web, and ceded it all to the platforms. What held promise ten years ago\u200a—\u200athat the web would spawn an ecosystem of millions of robust, connected voices\u200a—\u200awas lost to an oligarchy of Facebook, Google, and to a lessor extend LinkedIn, Twitter, and Snapchat. But I deeply believe we can bring it back. And yes, I believe advertising has a role to play. And Big Data. And subscription, but not if it’s of the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://shirky.com/writings/fame_vs_fortune.html" target="_blank" data-href="http://shirky.com/writings/fame_vs_fortune.html">micro-payment</a>, subscribe-to-just-this-site variety.</p>\n<p id="f84f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We can get there, but not without all of us getting together and figuring out what our next steps should be.</p>\n<p id="f7c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Who’s in?</p>\n<ul class="postList">\n<li id="f79e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Yes, yes, YES, I saw the fucking </em><a class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" href="https://media.fb.com/2017/01/11/facebook-journalism-project/" target="_blank" data-href="https://media.fb.com/2017/01/11/facebook-journalism-project/"><em class="markup--em markup--li-em">news from Facebook</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--li-em"> today. Great! You know the best way to change this formula? Tilt the revenue gains to the publishers, and make sure they have kickass analytics (and real data!) about their readers. You know, get them paid, for reals, and connect them to their audiences, for reals (IE stop preferencing your platform over theirs). I’ve not spoken to a single publisher who feels they are getting reliable, understandable, reasonable, or meaningful revenue or data from chasing Facebook traffic. Fix that, be a hero. I doubt it’ll be more than a rounding error in overall Facebook revenue or growth.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<figure id="d465" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--li graf--last">\n<div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><a href="http://battellemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gazetteer.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-18839" src="http://battellemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gazetteer.jpg" alt="gazetteer" width="499" height="500" /></a></div>\n</figure>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/2017/01/we-must-fix-this-fucking-mess.php">We Must Fix This Fucking Mess</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://battellemedia.com">John Battelle&#039;s Search Blog</a>.</p>\n<div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=cSVmJjaIrrg:XYrBkhgXPnQ:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=cSVmJjaIrrg:XYrBkhgXPnQ:D7DqB2pKExk"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?i=cSVmJjaIrrg:XYrBkhgXPnQ:D7DqB2pKExk" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=cSVmJjaIrrg:XYrBkhgXPnQ:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=cSVmJjaIrrg:XYrBkhgXPnQ:-BTjWOF_DHI"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?i=cSVmJjaIrrg:XYrBkhgXPnQ:-BTjWOF_DHI" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=cSVmJjaIrrg:XYrBkhgXPnQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?i=cSVmJjaIrrg:XYrBkhgXPnQ:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JohnBattellesSearchblog/~4/cSVmJjaIrrg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': None, 'enclosures': None}

And as I look back on the previous 13 and consider what to write, I&#8217;m flooded with uncertainty. That&#8217;s not like me. Writing these predictions is something I&#8217;ve always looked forward to &#8211; I don&#8217;t prepare in any demonstrable way, but I do gather crumbs over time, filing them away for the day when I sit down and free associate for however long it takes me to complete this post.</p>\n<p>But this time, well, for the first time ever I have very little idea what&#8217;s about to come out of the keyboard. Honestly, when I consider the coming 12 months, so much feels up for grabs that I wonder whether\xa0it&#8217;s wise to prognosticate. Then I remember, it&#8217;s all of you reading these words who keep me writing in the first place &#8211; your encouragement, your wise (and sometimes cutting) commentary, and your willingness to spend a little time with me and my thoughts. One of my New Year&#8217;s resolutions is to write more &#8211; it&#8217;s always been how I make sense of the world, and this year, the world feels like it needs a lot more sense making. So I&#8217;ll be writing at least a few times a week going forward, starting with this uncertain post.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see what happens&#8230;.</p>\n<p><strong>1. The bloom comes off the tech industry rose.</strong> Two years ago, I predicted that the tech industry would wake up to the power it had accrued\xa0and start giving a shit both about its impact on the world, and about the world&#8217;s largest problems, with climate change being the most pressing of them. That didn&#8217;t really happen, despite truly commendable philanthropic, social, and climate change work done by all of the &#8220;Big 5&#8243; tech companies (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook). As of this writing, the technology industry is now the undisputed leader of the business world. Its power has concentrated into demonstrable oligarchy &#8211; beyond the Big 5, Uber and Airbnb are now being called\xa0to question because of their potential monopolistic, rent extracting behavior. But the industry&#8217;s philosophical outlook remains rooted in its days as a challenger brand. This can&#8217;t stand. 2017 will be the year the industry is cast as a villain &#8211; for its ravenous and largely opaque data collection practices, its closed and self-serving approach to its own platforms, and its refusal to acknowledge or address the very real externalities, particularly in <a href="https://medium.com/@ross/the-coming-tech-backlash-82b22e0c1198#.lysd0gttj">employment</a>, created by its products and services. Some of this backlash will be unfair &#8211; but that&#8217;s not my point. Society vilifies those in power who appear to be unfairly profiting from that power. And in 2017, tech will be that\xa0villain.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The conversation economy breaks out.</strong>\xa0This is certainly related to #1, if\xa0oddly oppositional. The Big Five will be in an all out battle to engage us through conversational interfaces this year. If you&#8217;ve been reading me for over a decade, you might remember my predictions around the &#8220;conversation economy.&#8221; I was a bit early (OK, a decade too early), but the technology and the consumer behavior/expectations are now aligned to allow for a breakout year in user experience to finally occur. This began in earnest last year with the hype around chatbots, and the ascendance of Alexa and Google Home, all of which followed on the heels of Google Voice Search and Siri. But what will really shift the experience will be the explosion of smart chatbots that actually get shit done &#8211; I&#8217;m with Kik CEO Ted Livingston, <a href="https://medium.com/@tedlivingston/chat-is-the-new-browser-cef0ead46c8b#.mla8ya6s1">chat is the new browser</a>. Combine smart chat with voice, and &#8230; well, we&#8217;ll start to see a new UX for the web. What&#8217;s the economic model for this new UX? Good question! But the key will be meaningful interaction between all these services, instead of attempts to create a vertically integrated, locked-down walled garden. But that will only happen if&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>3. Open starts to win again.</strong> It&#8217;s dangerous to link two predictions, because if one doesn&#8217;t work out, the other is likely to fail as well. It&#8217;s even worse to link your first three&#8230; but what the hell. Tech&#8217;s hegemony is so great at this point, that the only way I can see it breaking down is through a return to the open standards which bequeathed us the Internet in the first place. 2017 will be the year that open starts to win again as a business model and an approach to creating a developer (and hence consumer) ecosystem. Google can and should be the leader here, given its core DNA, but I&#8217;m not sure that will be the case. Now, what do I mean by open? Well, interoperability, for one. It&#8217;s great that anyone can create a chatbot on Messenger, or Kik, or WhatsApp, but true innovation will come when anyone can create a chatbot that works with\xa0all of them, sharing data and user profiles across platforms. The same goes for the marketing industry &#8211; publishers and marketers alike should be able to consolidate and leverage data across all meaningful platforms, instead of cultivating different patches in every service&#8217;s walled gardens.\xa0The same goes for consumers, of course &#8211; I want to know what data is being used to mold the choices being laid out in front of me (including the ads, and yes, my\xa0f*cking\xa0newsfeed!). There will be meaningful demand from &#8220;users&#8221; to have more fluid and intuitive controls of their experience. And if my #2 holds true, then voice becomes a literal lingua franca, rendering platform lock in long-term meaningless, because jumping from service to service will be\xa0as easy as saying &#8220;Alexa, WhatsApp my pal Chris with the results of my Google search on open platforms.&#8221; This year won&#8217;t be a turning point in this battle, but it will show meaningful progress, in large part because&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>4. Privacy\xa0will become a strong product category.</strong>\xa0These linked predictions are \xa0certainly becoming a theme. But last year saw strong growth for a number of stand alone privacy products like Signal and Confide, and the inclusion of strong crypto into massive platforms like iOS (remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute">FBI fracas</a>?), WhatsApp and Google (via its new Allo and Duo products). Influencers like <a href="http://avc.com/2017/01/what-is-going-to-happen-in-2017/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+AVc+%28A+VC%29">Fred</a> and many others are predicting a boon in this field, and I agree. But it&#8217;s one thing to encrypt your messaging. It&#8217;s another to secure\xa0your entire online life. That kind of security is hard to do, mainly because it obviates much of the value of the data harvesting\xa0which drives convenience in the consumer tech world. But fear of cyber warfare, fraud, and over-reaching marketers and government will create huge openings for consumer friendly versions of currently opaque products like PGP, password managers, and the like. And it&#8217;ll also drive political and consumer pressure for more robust consumer control around algorithmically driven consumer experiences. Smart companies won&#8217;t resist this trend, they&#8217;ll encourage it.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Adtech has a ripper of a year.</strong>\xa0Wait, I just predicted consumers will pivot to caring about privacy, but I&#8217;m saying the adtech business is going to have a great year?! Well&#8230;yes. Embrace the contradictions, because adtech is ready for its second act. It&#8217;s really sucked to be a leader in the advertising technology industry &#8211; half of the media industry openly hates your guts, and the other half is convinced your days are numbered because of the Google/Facebook oligarchy. But they&#8217;re all wrong. Advertising technology is, at its simplest, the ability to apply data to a decision at scale. And the more open and free flowing that data economy becomes, the better and more valuable the companies which enable it become. If my predictions 1-4 come true, then this one will as well: Independent, high-integrity companies in ad/martech are going to have a banner (no pun intended) year, because they&#8217;ll tack into the resistance the large platform players have to the trends I&#8217;ve outlined above. Watch: Sovrn Holdings*, AppNexus, Acxiom*, Trade Desk, and OpenX.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Apple releases a truly bad hardware product.</strong>\xa0OK, this one isn&#8217;t really tied to the others, but I think Apple&#8217;s poised to not just have a boring year (as I predicted it would last year,) but to really lay an egg for the first time in a very long time. It may be their answer to Amazon Echo/Alexa, or Google Home/Assistant, or it may be a follow on to the watch, or perhaps something the company has had up its sleeve for a few years that it feels obliged to roll out given its essentially uninspiring last few years of product releases. But in 2017, the press and the public will find a tangible reason to turn on Apple, and the company will likely respond by reorganizing, repatriating its cash (to curry favor with the current administration), and keep buying its way into the markets where it has repeatedly failed (IE, software as a\xa0service, entertainment (NetFlix?!!), and possibly social media).</p>\n<p><strong>7. A Fortune 100 company will announce its intention to become a\xa0B Corp.</strong> Large companies are increasingly under pressure from employees, customers, and society to create value for more than just their shareholders. For decades, business was allowed to tax environmental, social, and societal resources in pursuit of profit. A new generation of consumers and employees are demanding that business ladder to more than simple profit, but rather, have a core purpose—one that makes the world a little (or a lot) better place.\xa0Of course,\xa0there&#8217;s already a corporate governance structure that encourages this approach to running a company—the Public Benefit Corporation, or B Corp. (I wrote about B Corps last year <a href="https://shift.newco.co/kickstarters-mission-is-non-negotiable-41520e7a5931">here</a>). My money is on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jan/23/benefit-corporations-bcorps-business-social-responsibility?CMP=share_btn_link">Unilever</a>, which has already been publicly discussing such a move. Two\xa0dark horses: Walmart and GE.</p>\n<p><strong>8. President Trump leaves Twitter.</strong> Ever since Twitter launched, I&#8217;ve usually included\xa0a Twitter prediction.\xa0This one sounds crazy, but it strikes me there are a few ways this might plausibly happen. Perhaps\xa0Trump will come to his senses and stop trying to run the country through a series of tweets. OK, that&#8217;s not very plausible. More likely is Trump will end up in some kind of a feud with Twitter over something utterly ridiculous, claim he&#8217;s the only reason the service is viable anymore, and decamp for Facebook, Snapchat, or who knows, maybe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VK_(social_networking)">VK</a>\xa0(that&#8217;s the largest Russian social media network, FWIW). Or maybe someone slips a cure for narcissism into his evening flute of Trump Champagne&#8230;.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Snap soars &#8211; then sours.</strong> I&#8217;m increasingly of the opinion that this company is going to force a total rethink of our online culture. In fact, I think most of us have no idea how over our skis we are when it comes to the power that Snapchat has aggregated. I&#8217;m not talking about typical tech power, like number of active users or advertising revenue. I mean the power of the platform to engage and exploit our pleistocene-era social brains. I&#8217;m not entirely sure Snap Inc. has fully grokked that power. But Snapchat feels like a step function beyond anything that has come before it. I watch my own children use it, and I&#8217;ve watched them fall in love with Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and countless pretenders (though I&#8217;m keeping my eye on Houseparty). Nothing compares to what happens when a group of kids connect on Snapchat. It literally becomes their social geography, and that fact will be widely recognized by the business community when Snap goes public. But almost hand in hand with that will come the Snapchat backlash, as scholars, alarmists, parents and school administrators speak out about the impact the app is having on the structure of society. Spectacles? By the end of 2017, those will seem quaint. Side note: There&#8217;ll be an amazing science fiction novel that comes out in early 2017 whose main protagonist will be compared to Snap. And yeah, that&#8217;s a fix, because I&#8217;ve already read it&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>10. Human connection commands a premium in the workforce.</strong>\xa0OK, OK, this has certainly been the case for all of history, at least &#8211; <em>ahem</em> &#8211; \xa0for a certain kind of connectivity. But in an age where it seems every job can be replaced by AI or a robot (or both), we&#8217;ll see a shift in how society values previously under-appreciated jobs that cannot be automated away (or if they can, the automated version fails to deliver human connection). Think about jobs that are socially valuable, require direct human contact, but are currently very poorly remunerated: Teacher, nurse/home care aide, waiter, small business owner, musician/artist come to mind. In 2017, we&#8217;ll come to realize that we&#8217;re valuing the wrong things, and start a conversation about paying people to connect with each other &#8211; because if we can automate the other stuff, why the heck wouldn&#8217;t we value each other more?!\xa0Related: The conversation around Universal Basic Income (or my preferred term, the Citizens&#8217; Dividend) will become white hot (it&#8217;s white hot in the Valley at present, but it&#8217;ll move into broader circles in 2017).</p>\n<p>Well that&#8217;s ten predictions, which seems like a nice round number. As I review them, I realize there&#8217;s a pretty high chance I could seriously whiff this year.

It&#8217;s kind of fun to look back and see how wrong (or right) my musings end up being.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be writing my Predictions 2017 post this weekend (I think), and publishing it shortly thereafter. But for now, let&#8217;s take a stroll down memory lane, and see how I did. Here&#8217;s a short report card for each of my twelve 2016 predictions.</p>\n<p><strong>#1 &#8211; 2016 will be the year that “business on a mission” goes mainstream.</strong>\xa0Well, this was pretty self serving, given\xa0it&#8217;s at the core of the work I did all year long at <a href="newco.co">NewCo</a>\xa0and<em> <a href="shift.newco.co">NewCo Shift</a></em>. But I did predict that massive companies would put their missions at the core of their marketing, and that certainly happened with corporations like Unilever, Ikea, H&amp;M, and many others. I also said the press would start covering the story as a regular beat, more than just annual &#8220;doing good by doing well&#8221; lists. While coverage (and the number of those annual lists) has increased, I can&#8217;t argue the story has broken out as big as I expected. And while organizations like <a href="https://justcapital.com/">Just Capital</a> have launched to track company\xa0data beyond price and profit, I think this story needs another year or two to mature. Overall, this prediction trended in the right direction, but didn&#8217;t fully come true this year, so\xa0I&#8217;m going to give myself a (noble, well intentioned) whiff on this one.</p>\n<p><strong>#2 &#8211;\xa0Mobile will finally mean more than apps.\xa0</strong>It may seem counterintuitive, but I think this is the year my mobile prediction actually came true. Here&#8217;s the detail from my post: &#8220;by year’s end, we’ll find ourselves interacting with our technology in new and far more “web like” ways – bouncing from link to link, service to service, much as we did on the original web, but with the power, context, and sensor-laden enablement of mobile apps and devices.&#8221; In fact, that&#8217;s exactly how using my phone now feels &#8211; deep linking has gone mainstream, and more often than not a link from a search opens an app on my phone, or a call to action in an email or inside an app opens another app &#8211; or a mobile web view &#8211; inside a third party site. Plus, every new release of Android (I don&#8217;t use iOS) seems to increase the utility of notifications, voice, and search. That&#8217;s how the next generation internet should work, and it&#8217;s here, now. Which is a really good thing (and augurs some very cool new opportunities, which I&#8217;ll probably explore in my predictions post). I&#8217;m going to grade myself a &#8220;mostly nailed it.&#8221; Why mostly? Because at the end of my prediction, I said Google&#8217;s <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/11/18/9755890/google-can-now-stream-apps-to-your-phone">app streaming</a> was going to help make it all happen. While the company continues to refine and roll out the service (and related services like <a href="http://qz.com/687687/soon-youll-never-need-to-download-another-app-again/">Instant App</a>s, or Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2015/214/">On Demand Resources</a>), I deserve a ding for that call. I&#8217;d rate it a 75% win.</p>\n<p><strong>#3 &#8211;\xa0Twitter makes a comeback. </strong>I don&#8217;t really need to go into much detail here. This did not happen. It&#8217;s all about the product. And while the election certainly helped Twitter, Twitter did not help itself much this past year. My wishful thinking earned me a fail on this one. Damnit Twitter, please be all we know you can be in 2017!</p>\n<p><strong>#4 &#8211;\xa0Adtech and the Internet of Things begins to merge. </strong>Weeks after I wrote this prediction, the industry bellwether Dmexco, arguably the most important marketing conference in the world, declared that <a href="http://www.innovationworldcup.com/dm/">IoT was the future of adtech.</a>\xa0Core adtech companies &#8211; Google, Facebook, Amazon (yes, Amazon is a serious player in adtech) &#8211; all released key products or platforms that vector IoT directly into their adtech strengths (Google Home? Check. Facebook Messenger\xa0bots? Check. Amazon&#8217;s Alexa/Echo? Check.) This merger will be messy and fraught, but bots and voice are the future for all the major internet players, and advertising business models and tech platforms will drive them all, in new and perhaps unexpected ways. Add to that the unprecedented amount of work done this past year in autonomous vehicles (which is\xa0a major IoT category and of course, a huge advertising platform in and of itself), and I think it&#8217;s fair to say this prediction came true. However, there&#8217;s a lot more to this trend than just merging advertising and IoT. That&#8217;s the easy (and obvious) part of the equation. The less obvious work remains to be done &#8211; as I wrote in the prediction: &#8220;I’m suggesting that the underlying technology powering adtech is perfectly suited to execute\xa0the highly complicated and highly performant rules-based decisioning required for\xa0the Internet of Things to touch our lives on a regular basis.&#8221; I honestly don&#8217;t know of any development\xa0over the past year that proves this part of my prediction, but I can&#8217;t imagine it&#8217;s not being worked on by the Amazons, Googles, and Facebooks of the world. We did have a major IoT event that proved the power of my predicted merger: Hackers harnessed millions of poorly secured IoT devices to mount <a href="http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/10/23/internet-things-security-under-scrutiny-after-home-devices-were-turned-hackers">massive DDOS attacks</a> across the web.</p>\n<p>Oh, and at the end of this prediction, I ventured that in 2016, we&#8217;d see a blockchain based adtech player emerge. We did see the emergence of <a href="https://www.bitteaser.com/">BitTeaser</a> and its related <a href="https://hubdsp.com/">HubDSP</a>, though they are in very early stages as of now. Overall, I&#8217;d say this prediction played out &#8211; score it as another 75% &#8211; a passing grade, at the very least.</p>\n<p><strong>#5 &#8211; Tesla’s Model 3 will garner more than 100,000 pre-orders. </strong>Many of you thought I was crazy to predict massive orders for the Model 3, but&#8230;.Tesla blew through my most optimistic numbers. Orders are now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/18/tesla-model-3-delivery-date-moves-to-mid-2018-or-later-for-new-orders/">approaching half a million</a>, and counting.</p>\n<p><strong>#6 &#8211;\xa0 Publishers and platforms come to terms.\xa0</strong>This is a hard one to prove. I wrote: &#8220;In 2016, Medium, LinkedIn, and Facebook will all make strides in helping all publishers succeed.&#8221; And I think this is largely true. Medium rolled out a publisher program, and limited, but improving advertising options for its publishers. LinkedIn hasn&#8217;t yet rolled out a publisher friendly platform, but it&#8217;s become a crucial traffic driver for a lot of publishers, and I&#8217;ve heard plenty of well-sourced rumors that a publishing platform is coming once the Microsoft integration is complete. And Facebook, well, Facebook had an uneven year when it comes to publisher relations, but there isn&#8217;t a serious publisher in the world who isn&#8217;t busy integrating with Instant Articles and the Newsfeed in one way or another. Add in publisher centric moves from Google (Amp, etc), and Apple (Apple News continue to grow, slowly), and I&#8217;d give this prediction a passing grade.</p>\n<p><strong>#7 &#8211; Search has a dominant year, thanks in large part to voice and AI.\xa0</strong>I think this also came to pass this year. We can debate if &#8220;traditional search&#8221; had a dominant year, but that was not my point. Search is in transition to new models based on voice and AI-assistants like Siri, Now, Alexa, and Cortana, and in 2016, these most certainly came into their own. I predicted that search volume, if once counted voice and AI, would be &#8220;way up&#8221; in 2016. Voice search volume did indeed <a href="http://searchengineland.com/voice-search-explosion-will-change-local-search-251776">explode</a> in 2016, but we&#8217;ll have to wait for Mary Meeker&#8217;s mid year update to know by exactly how much. Regardless, I think I got this one right.</p>\n<p><strong>#8 &#8211;\xa0Apple endures a boring year.\xa0</strong>Yep, this pretty much happened. I wrote: &#8220;short of yet another iPhone folks feel obliged to purchase, there’ll be nothing spectacular. I don’t think folks will be calling for Tim Cook’s head, but many will wonder if Apple is meandering its way toward a boring, profit-milking middle age.&#8221; <a href="https://www.google.com.au/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=apple%20product%20boring">Check</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>#9 &#8211; Microsoft and Google get serious about hardware.</strong>\xa0 Oh yes, they sure as hell did. Microsoft became a billion dollar a quarter\xa0player in tablets/computing with <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2016/10/23/microsoft-surface-book-success-continues/#418457227aca">Surface</a>, and Google rolled out Home, Pixel (its first true Google phone), and more Chrome gadgets. Both companies are very, very serious about hardware now.</p>\n<p><strong>#10 &#8211; Medium has a breakout year. </strong>I wasn&#8217;t sure this was going to happen, but just this month,\xa0Medium <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/12/14/medium-grows-140-to-60-million-monthly-visitors/">released its growth numbers</a> &#8211; up 140% year on year, to 60 million users. Combined with the launch of its publishing platform and the release of far better iOS and Android apps, Medium was indeed on a tear in 2016.</p>\n<p><strong>#11 &#8211;</strong>\xa0<strong>China goes shopping.</strong> In 2015, we all expected Chinese companies like Alibaba to start snapping up startups left and right. It didn&#8217;t exactly happen. But I predicted that 2016 would see it come to fruition, and indeed Chinese firms were very busy this past year. China dealmaking <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-china-deals/">rose 145% in 2016</a>, according to Bloomberg, and Internet and Software was one of the hottest sectors, with adtech &#8211; much maligned for years &#8211; a major\xa0<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/medianet-acquisition-chinese-ad-tech-arbitrage-play-2016-8?r=US&amp;IR=T">standout</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>#12 &#8211; Sports unbundle.\xa0</strong>Well&#8230;.no. I really, <em>really</em> wanted to drop\xa0my cable sub this past year, and the only thing keeping me from doing so\xa0was my beloved San Francisco Giants. Alas,\xa0nothing happened this year that will change that. There was a lot of <a href="http://12. Sports unbundle.">hand wringing</a> about the future of sports-driven brands like ESPN, and nearly everyone things sports will someday unbundle, just as HBO and many others have recently done. But not this year, so&#8230;my wishful\xa0prediction was a swing and a miss.</p>\n<p>Summing up, how&#8217;d I do? Pretty darn well, it turns out. I whiffed on only three &#8211; Business on a mission, Twitter, and Sports &#8211; and pretty much nailed the rest of them.

But it&#8217;s not often I look back farther than one year to see if perhaps I was just a tad too early. It appears in the case of Google and personal data, I was.</p>\n<p>In my <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/2015/01/predictions-2015-2.php">predictions for 2015</a> I wagered\xa0that Google would &#8220;face existential competition from Facebook&#8221; forcing it to &#8220;connect its search and personal data to its Doubleclick asset.&#8221; This was a debatable prediction &#8211; Google had long prided itself on its privacy policies, and when it acquired DoubleClick, it canonized its stance with this line in its <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">online policy</a>:\xa0<em>“We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.”</em></p>\n<p>That line is now gone. In its place is this:<em> &#8220;Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Put another way, Google has capitulated to the power of Facebook&#8217;s online identity tsunami, and has connected all the information it has about us\xa0&#8211; our search history, usage of Google apps like Gmail, Docs, or YouTube, and our history of interaction with Google&#8217;s advertising business &#8211; so as to better target us on behalf of advertisers. Of course, this move also allows Google to \xa0better compete with Facebook, which\xa0can target Facebook users &#8211; and now <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/27/11795248/facebook-ad-network-non-users-cookies-plug-ins">even non users</a> &#8211; across the web.</p>\n<p>Given I predicted this would happen, I&#8217;m not that surprised it finally did\xa0&#8211; in fact, I&#8217;m surprised it took this long. To its credit, Google has made the shift by asking its customers to opt in &#8211; but the process, as described in <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-personally-identifiable-web-tracking">this ProPublica piece</a>, was\xa0pretty opaque.</p>\n<p>Pulling back, I actually believe this represents good news for the web, and for the evolving adtech industry. For years we&#8217;ve built an open web advertising infrastructure based on anonymity, even as Facebook leveraged its native advantages based on real identity. If we can get to the point where advertisers can actually know who they are communicating with, perhaps our advertising ecosystem will evolve to a place where it adds value to consumers&#8217; lives on a regular basis, as opposed to interrupting and annoying us all day long. When that happens, Facebook&#8217;s implicit advantage &#8211; that it knows who we are &#8211; will become commodified, and perhaps &#8211; just perhaps &#8211; the open web will once again thrive.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: Google reached out with a clarification &#8211; here&#8217;s their statement on the change:\xa0</strong></p>\n<p><em>Our advertising system was designed before the smartphone revolution. It offered user controls and determined ads&#8217; relevance, but only on a per-device basis. This past June we updated our ads system, and the associated user controls, to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices. Before we launched this update, we tested it around the world with the goal of understanding how to provide users with clear choice and transparency. As a result, it is 100% optional&#8211;if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged. Equally important: we provided prominent user notifications about this change in easy-to-understand language as well as simple tools that let users control or delete their data. Users can access all of their account controls by visiting My Account and we’re pleased that more than a billion have done so in its first year alone.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/2016/10/google-capitulates-to-facebooks-identity-machine.php">Google Capitulates to Facebook&#8217;s Identity Machine: Is This Good News For The Open Web?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://battellemedia.com">John Battelle&#039;s Search Blog</a>.</p>\n<div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=rN0KaSanlgk:n30nyn0D3us:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=rN0KaSanlgk:n30nyn0D3us:D7DqB2pKExk"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?i=rN0KaSanlgk:n30nyn0D3us:D7DqB2pKExk" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=rN0KaSanlgk:n30nyn0D3us:qj6IDK7rITs"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?d=qj6IDK7rITs" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=rN0KaSanlgk:n30nyn0D3us:-BTjWOF_DHI"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?i=rN0KaSanlgk:n30nyn0D3us:-BTjWOF_DHI" border="0"></img></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?a=rN0KaSanlgk:n30nyn0D3us:gIN9vFwOqvQ"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/JohnBattellesSearchblog?i=rN0KaSanlgk:n30nyn0D3us:gIN9vFwOqvQ" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/JohnBattellesSearchblog/~4/rN0KaSanlgk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': None, 'enclosures': None}

The description of Summer Hours in our <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/handbook">employee handbook</a> is\xa0simple:</p><blockquote>During summer, we work 4-day work weeks, aka “summer hours”. Summer hours are in effect from May 1 through August 31 each\xa0year.</blockquote><p>Summer Hours are one of my favorite practices at Basecamp\u200a—\u200abut not just because they are an extra day off each week. <strong>Keeping Summer Hours hones our prioritization skills and breathes fresh energy into our\xa0work.</strong></p><p>I think it’s a practice more businesses should adopt, and here’s\xa0why:</p><h4><strong>Summer Hours hone prioritization</strong></h4><p>When we say 4-day work weeks (32 hours), we mean it. We aren’t cramming 40 hours into 4 days. This is essential to our practice of Summer Hours. Why? The key is in the constraint.</p><p>Removing a day each week forces you to prioritize the work that really matters, and let the rest go. It’s not about working faster, but learning to work smarter. It’s about honing your prioritization, <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/vocabulary.md">scope hammering and judo</a>\xa0skills.</p><h4><strong>Summer Hours energize and connect\xa0us</strong></h4><p>During the summer here in Colorado, my family loves spending time outside camping and hiking. Having three-day weekends to do that feels like a luxury of time. We don’t feel rushed or stressed, and I return to work each Monday energized\u200a—\u200alike I’ve been on a mini-vacation.</p><p>Adding to that energy, in our <a href="https://basecamp.com/learn#hq-teams-projects">Basecamp HQ</a> we have a “What did you do this weekend?” <a href="https://basecamp.com/learn#automatic-checkins">automatic check-in</a> where everyone posts pictures and shares stories of their weekend adventures. This “non-work” check-in strengthens connections between everyone on the team, which is especially important for a remote\xa0company.</p><h4><strong>Summer Hours are\xa0seasonal</strong></h4><p>The most important aspect of what makes Summer Hours effective for us is <em>seasonality</em>. Because Summer Hours aren’t <em>normal</em> hours<em>,</em> we look forward to them and take advantage of them\u200a—\u200athey are a special\xa0treat.</p><p>Another side effect of seasonality is that when we transition back to normal hours, having 5 days a week feels like a luxury of time! We put our newly honed prioritization skills to good use, and get even more meaningful work done. It’s a virtuous cycle of improvement that builds season after\xa0season.</p><h3>Your Summer\xa0Hours</h3><p>I wrote this post to encourage you to think about how you can benefit from adding Summer Hours to your work. Here are two experiments I recommend trying:</p><ul><li><strong>Add a constraint to your week:</strong> Pretend you will be out of the office this Friday. If that were true, how would it change your week? What would you focus on? What would you cut? I do this thought experiment every Monday to help prioritize my\xa0week.</li><li><strong>Turn a vacation into a season:</strong> Instead of taking a <em>two week</em> vacation, what if you took Friday off for the next <em>two months</em>? How would that change your enjoyment of the summer season? I’ve found it to be more rewarding and relaxing.</li></ul><p><strong>Happy experimenting, and have a great\xa0summer!</strong></p><p><em>Do you have similar seasonal or productivity experiments that you try in your work? If so, I’d love to hear about\xa0them!</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d69631b0b8fc" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/why-we-only-work-4-days-a-week-during-summer-d69631b0b8fc">Why we only work 4 days a week during summer</a> was originally published in <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com">Signal v.

Oftentimes, when we’re asking for honest feedback, we simply receive a confirmation of what we want to\xa0hear.</p><p>We learn, “<em>Oh okay, it seems like everything is fine</em>” or “<em>I already knew that was an issue, so it’s all good\xa0there.</em>”</p><p>But what about the stuff you <em>don’t</em> know? How do you discern if an employee has an idea to improve the company that she hasn’t brought up yet? How do you figure out if an employee is frustrated with her manager? Or, how can you tell if she’s thinking about\xa0leaving?</p><p>That’s where we at <a href="http://knowyourcompany.com">Know Your Company</a> come in. We’ve spent the past three years researching, writing and refining hundreds of questions across almost 300 companies with 15,000 employees in 15+ countries.</p><p>From our 312+Know Your Company questions, below are the best nine that we’ve found to yield the most interesting insights for companies…</p><blockquote>#1: “Are you afraid of anything at\xa0work?”</blockquote><p><strong>Our findings: 67% of employees said, “Yes, I’m afraid of something at work”</strong> (753 employees answered this across 89 companies) when asked through Know Your Company. This result caught me off guard (almost 70% of employees are afraid of something at work!) but it goes to show the importance of showing vulnerability as a leader and digging deep to uncover the areas of the company (or people in the company) that employees may feel intimidated by.</p><blockquote>#2: “Have you seen something recently and thought to yourself ‘I wish we’d done\xa0that’?”</blockquote><p><strong>Our findings: 75% of employees said, “Yes, I’ve seen something recently, and thought to myself, <em>‘I wish we’d done that’</em>”</strong> (1,338 employees answered this across 221 companies) when asked through Know Your Company. Clearly, employees are noticing what competitors are doing and may have ideas for you to improve the business. Asking this question helps bring to light what those ideas\xa0are.</p><blockquote>#3: “Is there something we should measure in the company that we currently don’t?”</blockquote><p><strong>Our findings: 78% of employees said, “Yes, there’s something we should measure in the company that we currently don’t” </strong>(286 employees answered this across 78 companies) when asked through Know Your Company. This reveals a need to more closely examine the metrics we use to run our businesses, and ask employees if there’s anything not being measured that should\xa0be.</p><blockquote>#4: “Is there any part of the company you wish you were able to interact with\xa0more?”</blockquote><p><strong>Our findings: 81% of employees said, “Yes, there’s a part of the company I wish I were able to interact with more”</strong> (507 employees answered this across 72 companies) when asked through Know Your Company. An overwhelming majority of the employees we surveyed feel silo-ed. By asking this question, you’ll learn exactly which parts of the company they’d like more interaction with, be it a specific department or\xa0office.</p><blockquote>#5: “Are there any benefits we don’t offer that you’d like to see us\xa0offer?”</blockquote><p><strong>Our findings: 76% said “Yes, there are benefits we don’t offer that I’d like to see us offer” </strong>(1,807 employees answered this across 179 companies) when asked through Know Your Company. You may be thinking, “Ugh, of course most of my employees want more benefits”… However, what’s most revealing with this question is <em>which</em> benefits your employees are looking for. Many of the companies who asked this specific question have added key benefits that have helped retain employees, or even gotten rid of benefits no one is using. You never know unless you\xa0ask.</p><blockquote>#6: “Is there an area outside your current role where you feel you could be contributing?”</blockquote><p><strong>Our findings: 76% of employees said, “Yes, there’s an area outside my current role where I feel I could be contributing” </strong>(814 employees answered this across 135 companies) when asked through Know Your Company. This result is surprising, considering that most managers feel their employees are slammed and are already at capacity. Thus, this question all the more important to ask: You’ll learn very tactically where your employees want to contribute more to help push your business even\xa0further.</p><blockquote>#7: “Is there anyone at the company you wish you could apprentice under for a few\xa0weeks?”</blockquote><p><strong>Our findings: 92% of employees said, “Yes, there’s someone at the company I wish I could apprentice under for a few weeks” </strong>(2,217 employees answered across 190 companies) when asked through Know Your Company. This shows how much employees crave learning and developing their skills\u200a—\u200aespecially from others within the company. Asking this question will expose to you if this is similarly the case within your own\xa0company.</p><blockquote>#8: “Have you seen someone here do great work that’s gone unnoticed?”</blockquote><p><strong>Our findings: 76% of employees said, “Yes, I’ve seen someone here do great work that’s gone unnoticed”</strong> (1,485 employees answered across 209 companies) when asked through Know Your Company.

Well, “easy” is relative and “make money” is also kind of debatable, but I definitely have not left my\xa0house.</p><p>I’ve been in decluttering mode for the last couple weeks and have become super active with my local moms resale group on Facebook. For those of you not deep into Suburban Mom World, these are private groups of parents (almost entirely moms) who are buying and selling things—mostly kids’ stuff, but also adult clothing and kitchenwares and furniture. Laura Hazard Owen has an <a href="https://medium.com/@laurahazardowen/if-you-believe-that-i-have-a-jumperoo-to-sell-you-bec391fff348">superb write-up</a> of how these groups work. She’s in the Boston area and I’m just outside Chicago, but the mechanics are the same: Members put up a photo, price and description of the item they’re selling and interested buyers comment on the post to claim their place in line. Pick-ups are typically done via porch—that is, sellers leave their goods outside and buyers swing by to get them at their convenience, sticking cash in a mailbox or under a doormat. It is a remarkably efficient system and very addictive. I once almost commented “Sold!” on a friend’s photo of green tea Kit Kats before realizing it was a regular post in my News\xa0Feed.</p><p>The overachiever in me wanted to become the mogul of my Facebook resale group, and the business journalist in me wanted to figure out which items sell and why. Sitting in my basement among plastic storage bins filled with my daughter’s outgrown clothing and baby gear, and perhaps inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/u/c030228809f2">Jason Fried</a>’s advice that you should <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/20110301/making-money-small-business-advice-from-jason-fried.html">practice making money</a>, I set out on my little sales experiment. Here’s what I\xa0learned.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Qh9htFvp1fcELQPGwhgGqw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Items awaiting pick-up on my\xa0porch.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Copywriting Doesn’t\xa0Matter</strong></p><p>I was led astray by early success in offloading my DVD of Pride &amp; Prejudice for $3. Here’s what I\xa0wrote:</p><blockquote>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a person in possession of even a tiny fortune must be in want of this movie. Show how ardently you admire and love Colin Firth emerging from a lake wearing a clingy white shirt! This is a two-disc set. I just upgraded to Blu-ray so I don’t need the DVD\xa0anymore.</blockquote><p>Not only did I have a taker within the hour with three more buyers commenting “Next,” but I also got 16 Likes and inspired a mini discussion about how much everyone loves the movie. You are surely made of hardier stuff than I am, but I was powerless to resist such social media affirmation.</p><p>I knew I couldn’t match the wit of my favorite salesmom, a woman who’s elevated the For Sale post to a kind of performance art (here’s one: “Crushed purple blazer. Small tear in armpit which can be easily fixed, unless your armpit is a size 8. I shoplifted this from Saks 12 years ago. It’s beautiful and I’m probably going to hell.”) But I was convinced I’d have to pen Jane Austen-level copy every time. So for a Little Mermaid hooded swim cover-up in 2T, I wrote, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXKlJuO07eM">Thingamabobs? You’ve got plenty</a>. But do you have this adorable Little Mermaid cover-up?” I listed it for $2 and no one bought it. Meanwhile, other items whose posts were written in the sparsest language (3T shirt, VGUC, lots of life left, sf/pf PPU*, $3) sold just fine. I stopped being cute and just started listing the basic information. Of course, there are lots of sales scenarios where copywriting matters a great deal, but my weird bubble of a Facebook group did not appear to be one of them. I moved onto\xa0price.</p><p>(*very good used condition, smoke free/pet free, porch pick\xa0up)</p><p><strong>Pretty Much Everything Costs Five\xa0Dollars</strong></p><p>The Boppy is a U-shaped pillow designed for nursing. Mine was in good used condition and I also had two covers, one with a small tear in the seam. The pillow retails for around $30 new. One day, I saw a mom selling her Boppy and cover for $3. It was claimed almost immediately and then another woman commented “Next,” so I messaged that person and asked if she’d like to buy my Boppy and two covers. She asked how much I wanted for it and I hesitated. Three dollars seemed low, especially because I had an extra cover. But one of my covers had a tear. I didn’t know how to justify charging more than the other mom, so I said $3. She picked it up that afternoon.</p><p>The next day, a mom listed a Boppy and cover in the same condition for $2. Later that day, another mom listed her Boppy for free. Free! The local market for used Boppy nursing pillows had somehow collapsed entirely within two\xa0days.</p><p>I have no idea whether those second-day Boppy sellers even saw the earlier sale posts, let alone based their pricing on them. But I noticed that in my resale group, pretty much everything converges toward the $5 mark, regardless of original retail value. As Laura Hazard Owen <a href="https://medium.com/@laurahazardowen/if-you-believe-that-i-have-a-jumperoo-to-sell-you-bec391fff348">notes in her essay</a>, price and size tend to have an inverse relationship, resulting in a market where “you can sell a Jumperoo for maybe $5; you can sell two used pairs of Hanna Andersson baby socks for $5.” This is absolutely the case in my Facebook group. Even in cases where you can price items higher, the economics are hilariously skewed. I sold my daughter’s old crib and mattress for $30, a price so low that I’m not sure my husband feels fairly compensated for the time he spent looking for the hardware and instructions, not finding the manual either in the house or online, and then printing instructions off the Internet for a different crib model from the same manufacturer and carefully annotating them. I, on the other hand, felt fantastic about getting the crib and mattress out of the basement. And that brings me to the last thing I\xa0learned.</p><p><strong>It’s Not About\xa0Money</strong></p><p>In this mini economy, the value of a transaction is measured in something other than money. It’s about community! Oh barf, I know. But it’s true. As the seller, I accept a price below fair resale value for my daughter’s gently used dresses and bibs because it is a luxury to be able to private message my address to someone I’ve never met and trust that the money will simply appear under my doormat, without anyone getting scammed. I don’t use Craigslist anymore, but if I did, I would probably ask to meet in a McDonald’s parking lot or the lobby of my local police station (which specifically makes its lobby available for Craigslist transactions). It just feels too big and scary. And despite Facebook’s badgering, I have no desire to try their Marketplace, where you can post your items more publicly to people in your geography. The thought of complete strangers being able to see my name and profile photo is terrifying, and besides, the moms in my resale group who’ve tried Marketplace say they get bombarded by people who want to haggle. (I still haven’t worked out why I feel okay with dozens of Lyft drivers seeing my address and\xa0photo.)</p><p>On my resale group of 2,000-some people who live within a seven-mile radius, I feel safe. These are women that I know from my daughter’s preschool, my exercise studio, and the playground. Many of us are also members of two other Facebook groups of local moms that have become an indispensable source of hyperlocal news, recommendations for babysitters/handymen/birthday party venues, and general bonhomie. The resale group feels like an extension of that community.</p><p>I thought that I was providing something of value to the moms buying my used stuff. It turns out I get way more out of these little transactions as a seller. My husband and I had always planned to have more than one child. We recently, reluctantly changed our plans for a number of reasons, one of them being that my uterus seemed to have very different ideas about what the size of our family should be. I’ve been using the resale group as a kind of reverse retail therapy, a literal letting go of the idea that I should be keeping the nursing pillow and crib for a second kid. There are days when this turn of events makes me so sad I don’t want to leave the house. But I don’t have to! I go down to the basement, find something cute in a storage bin, snap a photo and post it. If I’m lucky, someone will buy it. I private message her my address, put the thing in a plastic grocery bag labeled with her name and leave it on my porch swing. Then I retreat to my office and listen for the sound of the porch door squeaking open. I pretend I’m not home. After she slips a few bills under my doormat and leaves, the door banging shut behind her, I feel a little lighter. Like I said before, it’s not easy and I’m not making much money. But I’m gradually feeling better. Very good condition, lots of life\xa0left.</p><p><em>To hear insights on making money from people who have been doing it for a long time, check out Basecamp’s podcast </em><a href="https://thedistance.com"><em>The Distance</em></a><em>, featuring the stories of businesses that have been running for 25 years or more.

When new people were hired, they were largely left to figure out how the company worked on their own. Our new hires were tasked with maintaining, improving, and supporting Basecamp’s products without any context about how those products came about. Our interns admitted they didn’t know who at Basecamp did what job, so they had trouble all summer knowing who to ping with questions. And I’ll admit that I thought ‘<a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/312-lingo-judo">judo</a>’ meant something literally about fighting for an embarrassing length of\xa0time.</p><p>When we were a company of 20 people, the sink-or-swim format worked okay. But as we grew to more than 50 employees, we needed something more structured. So, last year we started putting together a handbook.</p><p>Basecampers are great at writing but not so great at documenting, so we constructed everything in the handbook from scratch on Github. We went back and forth clarifying some of our more nebulous values and policies, and I tried to effectively communicate just how much food we eat at <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/our-rituals.md#meetups">meet-ups</a>.</p><p>Until today we kept the handbook private, accessible to only current Basecamp employees. But why keep it to ourselves?! The handbook is most useful to our newly hired folks and interns <strong>before</strong> they start at Basecamp. In fact, our newest programmer <a href="https://twitter.com/Rosapolis">Rosa</a>\xa0said:</p><blockquote>I had access to the employee handbook weeks before starting, and I loved that. I read it several times, not only because it was informative, but also because it made me feel super happy and excited about\xa0joining.</blockquote><p>We want all of our new employees to have that experience! On top of that, we want to publicly share our values and policies in external publications and oh, hmm, this blog. Maybe other companies can crib some of our cooler policies. Maybe the way we clarify our company values can help someone else clarify their company or individual values. So we took publicity to the extreme and <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/README.md#basecamp-employee-handbook">made the handbook viewable to everyone on Github</a>. Making our handbook public reinforces Basecamp’s dedication to transparency, and it means that the entire internet can now point out my\xa0typos!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/991/1*uIirc5t3j9noRetmNsP-RQ.png" /><figcaption>very polite typo notifications</figcaption></figure><p>So please read, rip apart, steal from (with credit), compliment, and criticize our new handbook.

It’s only seven of us, so you can imagine what traveling and meetups do to our customer\xa0support.</p><p>We have two people dedicated to customer support. They stagger their travel so when situations like this arise, someone is still on the ground answering email. Still, there are moments during a meetup like this where we can’t be as good about our response times on our support queue as we want to\xa0be.</p><p>What do we\xa0do?</p><p>We typically do our meetups in Chicago, and once in Boulder, CO in April. We got stuck in CO when the airport closed for a day due to snow [more on that crazy story <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/if-we-had-a-roadmap-8e10b7bb5e23">here\xa0:)</a>].</p><p>This time, Las Vegas came to mind as a place we could go in April and not have to worry about weather problems.</p><p>I’m also incredibly inspired with the effort Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappos, has put into resuscitating the Downtown area of Las Vegas. I highly recommend it as a place for meetups (Pro tip: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5Fn8y3113M"><strong>use the Real World Suite</strong></a> as a place to work during the\xa0day).</p><p>So we mainly stuck to the Downtown area of Vegas, but we did take advantage of some of the fun things also on “The Strip”. For example, we saw Cirque du Soleil’s\xa0Love.</p><p>And we also went to a fancy cocktail bar overlooking a gorgeous human-made waterfall.</p><p>This bar came from a bunch of recommendations, but when we sat down something was off. The table was a little wobbly, so I looked underneath it and saw what appeared to be\xa0blood.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IWxx5RxYwGI-c68PM4PmfA.jpeg" /></figure><p>Can’t be. Maybe someone just stepped on a raspberry and it hasn’t been cleaned up\xa0yet.</p><p>The experience remained “off”. It took about 20 minutes before anyone even came over to our table to take an order. The person finally taking our order only uttered 3 words: “Are you ready?” We all ordered water too. But even after another long wait for drinks, the water never came. We had to reorder that\xa0too.</p><p>A little later, someone working there dropped a glass behind me. They cleaned up half of it and left the rest. It seemed as if they saw the rest of the glass, but they didn’t do the work to sweep what wasn’t in easy\xa0reach.</p><p>I heard people, sitting down behind me, later step on the\xa0pieces.</p><p>Maybe it actually was blood under our\xa0table.</p><p>To top off the night, the bill came with an automatic 18% gratuity, likely because there were 7 of us. This place didn’t deserve anything close to this gratuity. But… we’d already spent too much time there for me to wait around to talk with someone about it. I just wanted to\xa0leave.</p><p>So why was it like this? The biggest cause we noticed was that the main waitress taking all of our orders was the only one working tables and serving drinks. She was slammed. Clearly she was too busy to handle this well and that’s not her\xa0fault.</p><p>But what’s interesting to me is how some simple a handful of words would have made all the difference.</p><p>If she had just said, “I’m sorry for the wait. We’re slammed today and my backup hasn’t shown up yet.” Our entire experience would have improved with those expectations.</p><p>At Highrise, when our support can’t be as top notch as we want it to, we make sure we tell you about it\xa0upfront.</p><p>Here’s what <a href="https://help.highrisehq.com/"><strong>our help site</strong></a> looks like when we’re on a company\xa0meetup:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Ek_GWBBhW8uxY7OW." /></figure><p>The yellow alert about our limited support is built into the custom made site so it’s easy to throw up in situations like these. It doesn’t go up often\u200a—\u200athe bi-annual company meetup, Christmas, an unexpected crisis.</p><p>But the effect has been tremendous. Instead of getting upset emails about a temporary slowness to our response times, we get email telling us to enjoy our holiday or time together and letting us know they appreciate the heads\xa0up.</p><p>It’s a strong lesson for those folks out there who are constantly trying to hide how things are really going. They make it sound like they have an international team running the business when really it’s just a solo entrepreneur making it all work. Or they pretend everything’s going great, even though everyone is clearly aware you’re barely getting\xa0by.</p><p>Pretending it’s something different doesn’t make it better. As your customers, we can tell. You might as well be honest. Exceed expectations every time you can.

So that means every hire is kinda a big deal! And we’ve made five in 2017, so I thought I’d introduce them.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/taramann"><em>Tara Mann</em></a> has joined our iOS team as its second designer, alongside Jason Zimdars. Our mobile teams are tiny, both iOS and Android got by with just one designer and two programmers since inception. But we thought it was time to have an extra mind in the mix to explore a wider array of designs before we dive into implementation. We’re thrilled to have Tara be that mind! She hails from New York and previously worked at\xa0Twitter.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/rosapolis"><em>Rosa Gutiérrez Escudero</em></a> has joined our Security, Infrastructure, and Performance team as a programmer with a special focus on on-call investigations. We’ve long rotated amongst all programmers the on-call responsibilities, dealing with customer issues that need deeper technical investigations and may require elaborate root-cause fixes. But as the burden has grown, and the breath of programmers we employ has widened, it was time for some dedicated attention. Rosa brings that attention and then some. A direct exchange from the team evaluating her application: “Jim: Holy shit. Ann: Indeed”. Rosa joins us from Madrid, Spain and has worked in software, as a cupcake barista, at a chocolate startup, and in academia. What a delicious background!</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/thatgalshanae"><em>Shanae Dykes</em></a> has joined Team OMG to help customers over email, phone, twitter, and wherever else they may need to reach us. The support team has been the fastest growing part of Basecamp in the last few years, as we’ve sought to offer 24/7 responses within 15 minutes or less the majority of the time. All that while signing up thousands of new businesses every week. Shanae is going to help us cope with that. She is from Alabama and helpfully gave us a quick training course in Southern slang we she joined, so we knew what “yonder” and “britches” meant before she started chiming in the campfires. She used to work at Apple in Applecare.</p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/eyceebe/"><em>Ashley Bowe</em></a> has also joined Team OMG. She’s in the minority of Basecamp employees who actually live in Chicago where we have our office. She was born in Argentina, but the place she really wants to go back to soon is Iceland, and it’s pretty hard to argue with that! Ashley worked at Venmo and Uber in the\xa0past.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/flora_saramago"><em>Flora Saramago</em></a> has joined the Core Product team as to work alongside Jeff, Pratik, and Tom as a Ruby on Rails programmer. She was the final, incredibly hard choice out of 600+ applicants to one of those rare general-purpose Rails openings we haven’t had in years. She impressed us deeply with her writing, multi-year wins in Rails Rumble, and volunteer coaching for Rails Girls. Flora joins us from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and worked at XL Solutions before.</p><p>So that’s the five wonderful women who’ve joined Basecamp in 2017. If you’d like to work with Tara, Rosa, Shanae, Ashley, Flora, and the <a href="https://basecamp.com/about/team">rest of the Basecamp crew</a>, we currently just have <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/become-the-newest-member-of-our-ops-team-d465e4232f3d">two openings on our Ops team</a>.

That’s pretty much a programming truism. Rarely directly challenged, lest one betray the foundational tenors of Proper Programming. But challenge it we should, and head\xa0on.</p><p>The standard justification for being maximally explicit is a kind one. Give a programmer looking at the code everything they need to understand how it works, right there, as if they knew nothing already. It’s an optimization for fresh eyes, those who see without knowing a surrounding context.</p><p>So to challenge explicitness as a core value, we need to start by questioning that optimizing for those fresh eyes. Should their needs really to be the main objective for a programming environment?</p><p>It could be. If you expect to have rapid churn of the people working on the code, it’s a fair trade to burden those who’ve acclimated with laborious ceremony, if it means those fresh eyes will have an easier\xa0time.</p><p>That’s a value judgment based on circumstance and experience. To value the experience of the newcomer at the expense of the productivity of the veteran and the succinctness of the code. In some environments, that’ll be the reasonable choice.</p><p>But that’s not the environment I’m interested in. At all. I love implicit code, or, as we call it in Ruby on Rails, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#convention-over-configuration">Convention over Configuration</a>. Consider this tiny snippet of\xa0code:</p><blockquote>class Person &lt; ApplicationRecord<br> belongs_to\xa0:company<br> has_many\xa0:assignments<br>end</blockquote><p>This beautiful excerpt is bursting with implicitness. Just on the database side, it implies that there’s a “people” table backing the “Person” record. It implies that there’s a single “id” primary key for that table. It infers that there’ll be a “company_id” foreign key linking rows in “people” to rows in “companies”.</p><p>Here’s an explicit version that expands those contextual assumptions:</p><blockquote>class Person &lt; ApplicationRecord<br> table_name “people”<br> primary_key “id”</blockquote><blockquote>belongs_to\xa0:company, foreign_key: “company_id”, class_name: “Company”<br> has_many\xa0:assignments, foreign_key: “person_id”, class_name: “Assignment”<br>end</blockquote><p>And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. It doesn’t even talk about the implicit validation of a belongs_to relationship or the introspection of columns to create attribute methods.</p><p>I’d hate to have to write explicit code like that all day, every day. I’m willing to trade the need for someone to learn the conventional context of Active Record in favor of being able to write succinct, clear, and, yes, implicit code. Slightly higher upfront costs, perhaps, but amortized over a lifetime of working with\xa0Rails.</p><p>This gets to the heart of examining the values of programming environments. A value stated in isolation does not illuminate. Saying “I like explicit code” without also accepting that this means “I like [writing a lot more, often repetitive, frequently boiler-plated] explicit code” is a disingenuous. Values only shine the light for choices when they’re voiced in opposition to different values that others might reasonably prefer.</p><p>It’s the same story with product values. If you say your product is “simple” or “easy”, you’re rarely saying much. Few are the competitors who’d take the opposite side of that plank, selling products that are “complicated” and “hard” (though it does happen occasionally!).</p><p>To carve out a meaningful, effective <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/">belief system</a>, you must be willing to give up something. To embrace explicit code, you must be willing to accept laborious ceremony and the boilerplate. To embrace implicit code, you must teach the context and unpack its at-first bewildering magic.</p><p>I embrace implicit code. I embrace the context. I swoon over magic. If you too fancy such sparkle, Ruby on Rails will probably resonate. If not, no worries, most other programming environments pledge allegiance to the defeat of magic and oppose the implicit. Pick your\xa0poison.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=66629bb81ee7" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/programming-with-a-love-of-the-implicit-66629bb81ee7">Programming with a love of the implicit</a> was originally published in <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com">Signal v.

Have you tried to start a business but needed some capital and someone said No?

So she decided to try making it into a business.</p><p>It turned into a bit of a thing in her basement. But life naturally got a bit more complicated when two kids entered the picture. She retired from the cheesecake business to help raise her children.</p><p>But the entrepreneurial bug bit again when her kids moved off to college. Evelyn and her husband Oscar moved to California and started selling their cheesecakes to restaurants and grocery\xa0stores.</p><p>Meanwhile, their son David realized his dream of a music career wasn’t working out. He moved West to see if he could help Mom and Dad with the business.</p><p>But he saw the business just wasn’t growing that\xa0well.</p><p>Trying to get other restaurants and shops to buy his mom’s cheesecakes was fraught with rejection. Too many gatekeepers saying No. Too many people controlling a distribution system of his Mom’s recipes. Too many people controlling their\xa0destiny.</p><p>My whole life I’ve bumped into people telling me no. It’s natural. There’s places we want to go and gatekeepers keep us out. It’s not always a bad thing. Sometimes we aren’t ready. But other times, we know we are. We just need a\xa0shot.</p><p>So we have to start a blog and create our own readership.</p><p>We have to self-publish that\xa0book.</p><p>We have to bootstrap and raise our own funds from customers for that new business.</p><p>The Overtons decided they could control distribution better by opening a restaurant to showcase their awesome cheesecakes.</p><p>You’ve probably eaten their food.

Dumb Little Man - Tips for Life
{'title': '10 Ways to Avoid Making Your Kid Resent You', 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DumbLittleMan/~3/4Q7hTSm8nGI/', 'author': 'Chris Ellis', 'date': '2017.05.05', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/DumbLittleMan', 'value': '<p>When I was younger, I worked in a nursing home. It was a sad and disheartening place to work. The people you&#8217;d normally find there are not in their best condition and it was heartbreaking on most days.</p>\n<p>On weekends, the grown children of some of those people would come to visit. They&#8217;d sit awkwardly on the stiff chairs, obviously just fulfilling their duty. However, once the obligatory hour and a half were over, they&#8217;d quickly walk out looking visibly relieved.</p>\n<p>The parents would be left with nothing else but to look forward to when their children would be back next. Some residents had no visitors at all. It was so sad to watch.</p>\n<p>On occasion, there would be a special resident, one who always had visitors. The children of this person would stay the entire length of the visiting hours and show up punctually the next week. Many times, his family members would bring dinner. His grandchildren would come on weekends and the halls would turn into a family reunion every Saturday.</p>\n<p>And I asked myself, what was the difference between these two sets of circumstances? How were these residents different?</p>\n<p>So, I started to look at my own situation and of the people around me. I finally came up with the most important items that would ensure a long and loving relationship with your children.</p>\n<h3>Let your kid be whatever or whoever he wants to be</h3>\n<p>Identity is very important to anyone.</p>\n<p>When you were young,\xa0you probably had a good idea of wanted you to be- a teacher, pilot or doctor. Although you did not grow up to be those things, you were pretty much decided at that time.</p>\n<p>Kids, as they grow, change their minds almost as quickly as\xa0sand falling from an hourglass. It is what they do. If you do not allow them to be who and what they want to be when they want to be it, they will resent you.</p>\n<h3>Don&#8217;t force them to share their toys</h3>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34551 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/personal-toys.jpeg" alt="personal toys" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/personal-toys.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/personal-toys-400x266.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>I know this is a sore subject for some.</p>\n<p>When we were young, we were taught that nice people share. Our parents would take away our toys and give them to another child to play with.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at this from another perspective.</p>\n<p>How would you feel if your boss or your parent insisted that you give the keys to your new car to your friend just because nice people share? You would hate it. After all, it is YOUR car.</p>\n<p>Well, if the toys truly belong to the child, shouldn&#8217;t he be the one to decide whether he should share or not? If you take his possessions away, he will dislike you as much as you would dislike someone who takes your things.</p>\n<p>Instead of forcing him to share his toys, keep a separate basket of toys that are for everyone. This will make it easier for him to share\xa0with his playmates.</p>\n<h3>Stop finding fault</h3>\n<p>Some parents never realize that their kids grow up. They continue to correct them all their lives without knowing that it embarrasses and upsets the kids. Nobody likes to be constantly told they are not measuring up. No one wants to be corrected all the time.</p>\n<p>If your boss did that to you, you&#8217;d probably quit. So, validate the things your child does right instead of constantly correcting the things he does wrong.</p>\n<h3>Know when there is something very important to your child</h3>\n<p>When my son was thirteen, he wanted his ears pierced very badly. His dad did not want this. So, my son, being the resourceful and totally badass kid that he is, recruited his little brother to steal sewing pins from my sewing basket and did it himself.</p>\n<p>I didn’t realize what had happened until I noticed that he was wearing his hoody all the time- even in 90-degree heat. I pulled the hood off and there were my sewing pins sticking out of his earlobes.</p>\n<p>Now, I could have gone ballistic, but all I did was laugh. I told him to take out the pins, let his earlobes fully heal and I would take him to a nurse to have it done right. In short, I knew I was licked.</p>\n<p>Now, ear piercing is not a life or death thing so I could afford to be magnanimous. Some things aren&#8217;t, so make sure to choose wisely which issues to stand your ground.</p>\n<h3>Make the ratio of your time together way overbalanced on the fun and happy side</h3>\n<p>One of my biggest regrets in life was that I was so stressed out trying to work an insane job while raising my kids. I should have given myself more breaks. For that reason, the happy times were fewer.</p>\n<p>Everything that happens to us, we will remember as either happy or unhappy.</p>\n<p>Summer vacations and birthday parties are some of the events we consider happy. These are times we think of as pleasurable. Dentist appointments, on the other hand, are sucky\xa0so we consider them as unhappy.</p>\n<h3>Don’t give them too much</h3>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34550 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/happy-girl.jpeg" alt="happy girl" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/happy-girl.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/happy-girl-400x266.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>This is a problem for many parents and I&#8217;m guilty of this one, too.</p>\n<p>I grew up in a house with seven kids. I shared a bedroom with three sisters in bunk beds shoved against the wall. There was little money for buying clothes. It was only when I was thirteen that I could finally babysit and buy the clothes I wanted.</p>\n<p>Because of this, I thought it was best\xa0to give my kids everything I wanted as a child but could not have. This, unfortunately, made them feel overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t until later that I realized that I was making them miserable while trying to make them happy. They felt that there was no way they could contribute back.</p>\n<p>When I finally let them work and make money to buy what they wanted, they became resourceful and happy.</p>\n<p>You cannot make up for a hard childhood by buying things for your kids. You make up for it by being a loving parent.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also:\xa0<a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/teaching-children-values/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">What You Need To Know About Teaching Children Values</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Let them make you laugh</h3>\n<p>Everyone loves someone who finds them sparkling, charming and amusing. When your child makes you laugh, have you noticed how he tries to be funnier and funnier? Making you laugh is a gift from him to you. And laughing at his jokes is a gift from you to him.</p>\n<p>Was there ever someone who made you feel sparkling, charming and amusing? How did you feel about that person?</p>\n<h3>Touch their hair as they pass</h3>\n<p>There is nothing like physical touch to make a person feel that you really want to share your space with them. Kids love to cuddle and get close.</p>\n<p>I have endless photos of me and my son as he was growing up. In each one, our arms are entwined.

No parents hate or dislike their kids unless they have serious issues. Our parents just got overwhelmed and upset as we were growing up, and our kids, when they grow up, will probably feel the same way, too.</p>\n<p>Show your kids a good example and overlook all the upsets for the time you have left with your parents.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also:\xa0<a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/healthy-habits-for-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">Top 10 Tips to Help Children Develop Useful Habits</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Always be willing to start over</h3>\n<p>My oldest son and I used to have fights.

{'title': '11 Life Hacks All Lazy Girls Definitely Do', 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DumbLittleMan/~3/mwyo0tv36p4/', 'author': 'Catherine Anne Grant', 'date': '2017.05.05', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/DumbLittleMan', 'value': '<p>Every lazy girl knows a few tips and tricks to look her best and arrive on time with as little effort as possible. To give you an idea, here are a few lazy girl life hacks you can try to simplify your life:</p>\n<h3>Dry Shampoo / Baby Powder / Cornflour</h3>\n<p>Maybe your shampoo ran out without you noticing or maybe you&#8217;re just plain lazy that day. Don&#8217;t worry! Dry shampoo can get you through another day of skipping the tedious hair-washing routine.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a great video that teaches you how to make DIY dry shampoo AND how to apply it to your hair.</p>\n<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fAEmWNpVAsc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>A little bit of baby powder or cornflour can go a long way– well, I mean a little. Blonde haired girls don’t have to worry too much about overdosing on powders. Brunettes, however, need to be light-handed with the powder and only apply enough to absorb excess moisture.</p>\n<h3>Air Out Your Dirty Laundry</h3>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34545 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dirty-laundry.jpeg" alt="dirty laundry" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dirty-laundry.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dirty-laundry-400x266.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>Haven’t had time to wash your favorite outfit that you’re dying to wear? No problem! Hang them out in the breeze to refresh your clothing and it’ll feel like they’ve just been through the wash.</p>\n<p>For added freshness, spray the garment with your favorite deodorant and iron it out to combat any smells and creases. After that, you’re good to go.</p>\n<p>If you know that you will have to hit the gym in the same pair of leggings twice in one week without a chance to give them a good wash between wears, make sure you take them out of your gym bag as soon as you get home and air them out straight away. This will help to dry the sweat and they’ll gain second-wear status.</p>\n<h3>Blow Dry Your Hair After a Gym Session</h3>\n<p>You washed your hair in the morning and decided to hit the gym. After your workout, you now feel sweaty and gross. Since your hair has just been washed, you can just get rid of the smell and sweat by applying dry shampoo.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that you can’t apply dry shampoo or powder to your hair while it&#8217;s still wet. So, pull out your hair dryer and dry up the sweat before applying dry shampoo and your hair will look as good as it did in the morning.</p>\n<h3>Knot Your Hair in a Bun</h3>\n<p>There are so many lazy girls who can’t be bothered to dry their hair and apply dry shampoo.\xa0Lucky for us, messy buns are all the rage. Toss your hair into a tight knot or bun and no one will know when you last washed it.</p>\n<p><center><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y8dI6PSpOXE?start=46" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></center>Quick tip: Braid your hair and style it before you go to the gym and you won’t have to touch it afterward.</p>\n<h3>Plan for a Good Snooze</h3>\n<p>Waking up in the morning can be hard work, and no one likes to get up with the first alarm. Take a leaf out of your lazy girl’s book and set your alarm a couple of minutes before the actual time you need to wake up. This will ensure that you get to hit the snooze button and still have time to get yourself ready in the morning.</p>\n<p>It’s a win-win!</p>\n<h3>Run Errands in a Sweatshirt</h3>\n<p>Running out of time? Need to go to the shops but you’re just too lazy to get changed?</p>\n<p>Throw a sweatshirt over your top and you’ll be able to run your errands with your pajama top on- and no one will know.</p>\n<p>Kick this tip up a notch and run your errands bra-less too. A cute sweatshirt needs to be in every lazy girl’s closet for the days when she’s struggling to find the motivation to get things done.</p>\n<h3>Refuse to Wear Jeans (or anything you can’t slide on and off)</h3>\n<p>Jeans are tough to get on and off and, let’s be honest, no one enjoys jumping around to get the button done. We don’t need that kind of negativity in our lives.</p>\n<p>Invest in some nice pants or leggings that you can slide on and off and you’ll be stylish, comfortable and ready to go at the drop of a hat.</p>\n<h3>Keep Makeup Removers With You At All Times</h3>\n<p>Some makeup products can be stubborn to remove. Keeping makeup removers in your bag or next to your bed can save you all the trouble. Your pillow will surely thank you, too.</p>\n<p>Added hack: If you didn’t manage to get all of the eyeliner off from the night before, build on it. Last night’s eyeliner is today’s eyeshadow.</p>\n<h3>Minimal Make-Up That Will Leave You Glowing</h3>\n<p>The best make-up essentials for any lazy girl are a good concealer, mascara, eyebrow pencil and blush.</p>\n<p>The concealer is perfect for covering any blemishes. Wearing mascara is a must if you want to look more awake and glowing. An eyebrow pencil is essential, too. Simply neatening up and darkening your eyebrows will have you looking well-kept in no time. Wearing a nice blush can give some color to your face. It&#8217;ll make you look youthful and flirty.</p>\n<h3>Braid Your Hair Before You Go to Sleep</h3>\n<p>Want to have flowing beach waves but don&#8217;t like putting too much effort?</p>\n<p>Braid your hair into a plait before you go to sleep and you will wake up with beautiful loose curls. This hack can also save you precious time in the morning, so you can hit snooze a few more times.</p>\n<h3>Use Your Hair Straightener As An Iron</h3>\n<p>This hack is an absolute life-saver and time-saver. Using your hair straightener as an iron will allow you to get your hair done and get rid of the creases in your outfits without taking up too much time.</p>\n<figure id="attachment_34576" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-34576 size-full" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hair-straightener-ironing.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hair-straightener-ironing.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/hair-straightener-ironing-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Via experthometips.com</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Bonus Life Hack:</h2>\n<h3>Use Testosterone Boosters to Improve Your Energy Levels</h3>\n<p>I know, ladies using testosterone boosters sounds ridiculous, but a lot of the time that people (both male and female) feel run down is because their hormones are out of balance.</p>\n<p>Testosterone boosters have proven to have numerous benefits for women, and they won’t make you big or bulky.</p>\n<p>Men and women require a certain level of testosterone and women are often on a birth-control pill, which messes with their natural hormone balance.

In essence, you have to implant that thing using the power of the subconscious mind.</p>\n<p>You can spend time each day visualizing exactly how your life is going to look. You can imagine yourself <em>there,</em> living the lifestyle you want, doing the things you want to do and being\xa0the person you want to be.</p>\n<p>Another way is to journal. It can help you imprint your goals in a much stronger way.</p>\n<p>You can try writing out your life in detail, repeating all those things you want to have in your life over and over again. Or you can meditate and spend time each day doing affirmations about who you’re going to be and what you’re going to have and do. You can do an evening gratitude list to get your mind to concentrate on the good things that are happening instead of the not-so-great.</p>\n<p>You dream, you visualize\xa0and you act.</p>\n<p>But, what if something comes along that knocks you sideways?</p>\n<p>You see, the thing is, you’re really\xa0powerful- unbelievably powerful.</p>\n<p>All the tools and techniques that I’ve listed out are just to help you harness and utilize the enormous power of the subconscious mind.</p>\n<p>The problem is that we let our subconscious minds get on with things.</p>\n<p>For a long time, our minds have ruled our lives. What the mind says, we believe. What the mind tells us to do, we do. The opinions our minds have seem like they’re their own. And for most of our lives, we’ve listened to our minds\xa0as though they are us.</p>\n<h2>We&#8217;ve Believed Everything It&#8217;s Told Us</h2>\n<p>And then, you suddenly decided that wasn’t good enough and you want to be in charge. You started exercising your mind on your terms, telling it what to think, where to place its attention, and even – heaven forbid – telling your mind that it&#8217;s wrong in what it&#8217;s thinking.</p>\n<p>Now, you might think that you’re in charge here and that you’re going to get that stuff together and harness the power of the subconscious mind as though it was some tidal power station. Unfortunately, your mind has other ideas.</p>\n<p>If you’ve been in charge for all those years, would you let go of control easily and quietly?</p>\n<p>Didn’t think so? Your mind isn’t going to either. It’s got way more subtle (sneaky) powers than you ever dreamed possible.</p>\n<p>You can visualize and journal and focus and imagine all you like.\xa0But, your subconscious mind will test your resolve- every time.</p>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34158 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/journaling.jpg" alt="journaling" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/journaling.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/journaling-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also:\xa0<a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/benefits-of-journaling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">5 Benefits of Journaling To Inspire and Motivate You</a></strong></p>\n<p>You say you want something? The mind will check if you really do. Your mind will create a massive roadblock that’s going to stop your visualization train in its tracks.</p>\n<p>Let’s say you’ve been visualizing a wonderful and relaxing Caribbean holiday. You’re imagining yourself there on the beach. You can hear the waves, smell the ocean and feel the warm breeze upon your skin. You’ve almost saved enough for your holiday. You’re going to go out after your next payday and book your trip.</p>\n<p>Then, your car breaks down and what do you know? The repair bill is what you’ve saved for your holiday TO THE DOLLAR!</p>\n<p>At this point, you&#8217;ll probably think “Why does this stuff always happen to me?” or “I can never get ahead” or “I\xa0knew I wouldn’t be able to do this.”</p>\n<p>But, consider this:</p>\n<p>That, my dear, is just your mind testing you. It&#8217;s just your mind at work making sure that you do want all the things you&#8217;re thinking about.</p>\n<h2>How Powerful Is Your Mind?</h2>\n<p>How powerful is your mind that it can create stuff like that? It&#8217;s extremely powerful.</p>\n<p>Instead of getting upset (like we tend to), acknowledge the power and creativity your mind has. See it as proof that you’re on the right track and your mind is just making sure. See it as evidence that you really can have everything you want. If not, the things you want are going to pose no problem.</p>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34503 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/subconscious-mind-1.jpg" alt="subconscious mind" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/subconscious-mind-1.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/subconscious-mind-1-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>Your job is to visualize the end result. Leave working out how to get there to your subconscious mind. It knows far more about how to work the universe than you do.</p>\n<p>So, next time you run into one of those roadblocks, don’t stop and just keep going. Get straight back into visualizing the end result, journal about it, do whatever you can to get that vibration back to the level you want.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also:\xa0<a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/mind-hacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">The Secret Mind Hacks That Can Change Your Life Today</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/power-of-the-subconscious-mind/" data-wpel-link="internal">What To Do When You Hit A Roadblock: The Power Of The Subconscious Mind</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com" data-wpel-link="internal">Dumb Little Man</a>.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DumbLittleMan/~4/TG5uCLb3RL0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': {'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com'}], 'link': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com', 'href': 'http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y281/irw2003/dlmsmall.gif', 'title': 'Dumb Little Man', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/DumbLittleMan', 'value': 'Dumb Little Man'}}, 'enclosures': None}

A decision, on the other hand, is an important component in how we approach this concept of surrendering for success and overcoming obstacles.</p>\n<p>The word decision comes from the same root word as incision which means ‘to cut’. When you make a decision, it is literally cutting out all other possibilities. So, when we decide to improve relationships, make money or lose weight, we start making specific moves towards that goal.</p>\n<p>When we come across oppositions or challenges, we can often become derailed- even by our own willpower. We become less excited and increasingly frustrated which can make us feel a bit hopeless. Because of this, it&#8217;s important that you know the best ways in overcoming obstacles in life.</p>\n<h2>How do you stay on track and keep going?</h2>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34497 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/stay-on-track.jpeg" alt="stay on track" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/stay-on-track.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/stay-on-track-400x266.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>Surrender to the process. Recognize the frustration for what it is and surrender to the fact that obstacles happen for a reason. They don&#8217;t just pop out for you to learn a lesson or change your approach, but, ultimately, they help you get closer to your end result.</p>\n<p>Don’t let disappointment take over or wear you down as it can only make you eventually give up. Instead, surrender to the idea that deciding to pursue your goals means you are agreeing to cut out obstacles that can impede you.</p>\n<p>This may require you to be more open-minded, learn new things and see fresh opportunities. Just do it! Those things will help you evolve into the kind of person required to reach your goals.</p>\n<h2>What’s the difference between surrendering and giving up?</h2>\n<p>Surrendering is different from giving up.</p>\n<p>Giving up is what most people do. They take a break from their goals and end up reverting to their old ways. Surrendering is what successful people do. They acknowledge the process and steadfastly decide to follow it through, surrendering to the path ahead. With this mindset, you&#8217;ll be able to accept and plow through challenging or frustrating scenarios like a bulldozer.</p>\n<p>When we truly surrender to the outcome, we surrender to the process. When you get to that point, you won’t care about the roadblocks anymore. You care about the result.</p>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34498 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/new-possibilites.jpg" alt="new possibilites" width="600" height="401" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/new-possibilites.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/new-possibilites-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>In other words, you have to open your mind to new possibilities. Normal activities bring about normal results. Very few people have their ideal body, a huge bank balance, and amazing relationships. Those who have one, or all of these things, have committed to trying an out-of-the-ordinary approach. These abnormal activities have created abnormal, enviable results.</p>\n<p>Once I truly decided that there was no other possibility for me &#8211; an overworked, underpaid mechanic &#8211; than to become a highly successful entrepreneur, I surrendered to that outcome and to whatever emotional states that could be triggered along the way. If I had to regroup and restart, then so be it.</p>\n<p>This decision led me to build a multi-million dollar business. Since then, I’ve progressed to achieving my body and fitness goals and I’ve also cultivated my dream marriage. I’ve created a truly extraordinary life!</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also:\xa0<a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/habits-of-highly-successful-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">4 Things Highly Successful People Do Differently</a></strong></p>\n<p>The person who has decided to be successful doesn’t beat themselves up about hiccups along the way; they just get busy creating what they desire. People who are living their purpose don’t have the luxury of feeling sorry for themselves; they forge ahead and take the steps required- in spite of it all.</p>\n<p>To start overcoming obstacles in life, you should surrender to the journey that is being revealed to you with each step you take. You’re beyond the point of questioning whether it&#8217;s worth it or not or whether it’s as easy as it should be or not. You just need to continue doing it. Enjoy the journey because your success will be a by-product of your new way of life.

You could even choose to only work on the weekends or at festivals, giving you the ultimate flexibility over your life.</p>\n<p>Having a brick and mortar store or restaurant means always having to be there while having a food truck means only showing up when you want to. Despite the flexibility, it is still important to maintain a schedule and show up when you say you will show up.</p>\n<p>Food trucks can be a great way to test the waters to see if opening a restaurant is for you. It could be a good lifestyle choice for parents with kids who need flexibility in scheduling and a place for the whole family to work.

This definition is relatively basic but, in life, so many people still don&#8217;t understand what they are worth.</p>\n<p>Building self-esteem is like forming a new habit. It takes small incremental efforts before it can become second nature. To help you out, here are some of the tips you can use.</p>\n<h3>Learn To Improve Yourself</h3>\n<p>Cherish opportunities to improve yourself. Start by acquiring knowledge and living through life experiences. This way, you&#8217;ll be able to appreciate your abilities and make good judgments that can inspire other people. Building self-esteem requires you to constantly experience self-improvement.</p>\n<h3>Know What You Want</h3>\n<p>Most people who have low self-esteem do not know what they want. They look to other people and wonder how others can be so successful.</p>\n<p>If you want to boost your confidence, you should know what you want. Set clear goals and be passionate about meeting them. Even just one cleared goal should improve your self-esteem dramatically.</p>\n<h3>Believe In Something Worth It</h3>\n<p>What do you stand for? What do you believe in that is worth protecting and, if need be, dying for?</p>\n<p>To build high self-esteem, you need to answer these questions. Unless you believe in something worth it, you will be swayed by anything. As soon as you believe in something worth it, you will be able to understand your limitations and know what to avoid when your belief is challenged.</p>\n<h3>Exercise Regularly</h3>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-31336 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/exercise.jpg" alt="exercise regularly" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/exercise.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/exercise-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>Those who engage in regular physical exercise will experience a remarkable improvement in self-esteem. Regular exercises will help you stay in shape and <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/3-powerful-ways-boost-self-confidence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">boost your confidence</a>.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also:\xa0<a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/19-ways-get-motivated-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">19 Ways to Get Motivated to Exercise</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Learn To Be Yourself</h3>\n<p>I have seen so many people try to live their lives as others do, without considering exactly what they want. This is a prelude to unhappiness.</p>\n<p>To start building self-esteem, you need to learn to be yourself and not someone else. Those who have high self-esteem are unique people. They do, see, think and act differently. Their uniqueness comes from within.</p>\n<p>They are not moved by ephemeral things. They do what they think is right and they do not listen too much to what others might say.</p>\n<h3>Learn Perseverance</h3>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34450 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/learn-perseverance.jpeg" alt="learn perseverance" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/learn-perseverance.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/learn-perseverance-400x266.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>You need to <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/ways-to-master-art-of-perseverance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">learn to persevere</a>. This will help you go through those periods when the flood of discouragements, failures and opposition mounts.</p>\n<p>Failures and setbacks will surely come, but your ability to persevere is what will see you through. Perseverance will help you appreciate hard work and gain confidence.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also:\xa0<a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/dont-be-quitter-perseverance-is-one-of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">Don’t Be A Quitter: Perseverance Is One Of The Most Underestimated Skills of Successful People</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Understand Life</h3>\n<p>To build high self-esteem, you should fully understand life, its purpose and what it truly means. Many people consider acquiring many cars, houses, jewelry and other material things as being successful. Your inability to understand life will make you hold onto things that do not matter. It&#8217;s like chasing shadows and going after the wind.</p>\n<h3>Avoid Discussing People</h3>\n<p>Avoid discussing people if you seek to boost your self-esteem. People who put others down or work to discredit others are insecure beings. As humans, it&#8217;s normal for people to\xa0commit mistakes. This, however, doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re bad.</p>\n<p>Look at yourself before criticizing others. Will you be happy when people discuss you behind your back or discuss your mistakes in a way to ridicule you? If you will not be happy, then don’t do it. Focus on issues and use your time wisely. Instead of wasting time discussing people, work on achieving your goals.</p>\n<h3>Help Others Succeed</h3>\n<p>There is so much competition in the world today and people are competing with one another in almost every aspect of life. As much as possible, do not take part in this trend.</p>\n<p>Instead, think of ways to help others. Most people with high self-esteem are adding value to people’s lives and inspiring them to succeed. They are always thinking of how to make the world a better place. When you help others succeed, you will also succeed.</p>\n<h3>Learn Something New</h3>\n<p>One way to build your self-esteem is to constantly update and build your knowledge. Reading is a good example. When you read, you learn something new and you improve yourself in the process.</p>\n<p>Another way to learn something new is to accept feedback from mentors and colleagues. You can use what they have to say to improve, grow and gain more self-confidence.</p>\n<h3>Be Generous</h3>\n<p>What are you giving to others?</p>\n<p>Being generous to others can help boost self-esteem. Remember, givers never lack.</p>\n<p>These are the ways I have gained high self-esteem over the years. Practice them consistently and\xa0you&#8217;ll find building self-esteem a lot easier.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/building-self-esteem/" data-wpel-link="internal">11 Secrets To Building High Self-Esteem To Find Happiness</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com" data-wpel-link="internal">Dumb Little Man</a>.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DumbLittleMan/~4/aYUfzEgdxf8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': {'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com'}], 'link': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com', 'href': 'http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y281/irw2003/dlmsmall.gif', 'title': 'Dumb Little Man', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/DumbLittleMan', 'value': 'Dumb Little Man'}}, 'enclosures': None}
{'title': '5 Rules To Overcome Limitations', 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DumbLittleMan/~3/R-9ow_CpMxg/', 'author': 'Ryan Steele', 'date': '2017.05.03', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/DumbLittleMan', 'value': '<p>If you take a look at the most successful people in the world, you&#8217;ll quickly notice that they all have something in common. These people have conquered their limitations and they don&#8217;t follow the norm.</p>\n<p>If you would like to achieve the same status, here are some of the best tips on how to overcome limitations.</p>\n<h3>Be Fearless</h3>\n<p>Most people want to get rid of their fear of failure. It&#8217;s the one thing they think is holding them back from being successful.</p>\n<p>You may find that the real reason you have yet to succeed is because:</p>\n<p>&#8211; You fear all the hard work that must be\xa0done<br />\n&#8211; You fear\xa0the commitment necessary both during and after\xa0you have succeeded<br />\n&#8211; You fear going out of your comfort zone</p>\n<p>On some level, that&#8217;s totally understandable. But, if you truly want to succeed, you must work harder than everyone else. And to do that, you&#8217;ve got to get rid of anything holding you back.</p>\n<p>I got rid of my fear\xa0by simply jumping into it and never looking back. I recommend you do the same.</p>\n<h3>Let Your Creativity Blossom</h3>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34308 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/creativity-blossom.jpg" alt="creativity blossom" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/creativity-blossom.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/creativity-blossom-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>The second rule to becoming limitless\xa0is to always be original.</p>\n<p>I am not talking about thinking in an original way. Anyone can do that. What I am talking about is having the courage to\xa0act on your plans. It&#8217;s going out there and implementing your ideas so that you can succeed faster.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s how successful people operate. They let their mind free and then support their amazing ideas\xa0by taking action.</p>\n<p>My advice would be to promise yourself that the next time you get a brilliant idea that can help you succeed financially, think it through thoroughly and then go for it!</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t hesitate. That&#8217;s what losers do.</p>\n<h3>Asking Questions Is a Waste of Time</h3>\n<p>If you really need to know the answer to something, you should ask, right?</p>\n<p>Wrong.</p>\n<p>Personally, I avoid asking people questions, especially if I could easily find the answer to them\xa0if I did some research myself. By asking others for answers, you start to rely on them. Relying on others limit\xa0you, which is exactly what you want to avoid if you\xa0want to overcome limitations.</p>\n<p>Another reason you should stop asking questions is because the answer is probably within you already. Oftentimes, we ask questions only because we seek others&#8217; confirmation and not the answer itself.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why I say, if you dig deep down within yourself, you&#8217;ll be able to find the answers. Therefore, follow your guts and trust no one but yourself. You are the only one who truly\xa0knows what you want.</p>\n<h3>Stop Doing What Others Do</h3>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you got 2 choices:</p>\n<p>1. Get\xa0hired by a company<br />\n2. Create\xa0a company yourself and hire others</p>\n<p>Most people would choose option 1 because that&#8217;s the norm and that&#8217;s what the majority does. This is exactly what I want you to completely stop doing. In fact, I recommend that you start playing around by doing one or two things each day that go against what the majority does.</p>\n<p>As an example, If I were to say if I like Donald Trump or not, I could play around by saying &#8220;yes&#8221; when everyone else answered &#8220;no&#8221;. Of course, I\xa0will have to argue\xa0about my choice after, but that&#8217;s part of the game.</p>\n<p>Playing against the norm is a great achievement because that means you&#8217;ll no longer be limited by the rules society places on your shoulders.</p>\n<h3>Believe With All Your Heart</h3>\n<p>If you stop believing in what you preach and practice, it&#8217;s just a matter of time\xa0before you meet the wall. You have to believe in your ideas so strongly because when the going gets tough, your mind will do one thing and that is to lie to you.</p>\n<p>Ignore your thoughts and say &#8220;I believe!&#8221; instead.</p>\n<p>Every big star,\xa0every big name, and every successful\xa0human being\xa0on\xa0this planet\xa0used to be big believers as well. In fact, don&#8217;t take it from me. Take it from one of the most successful people.</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><em>&#8220;You don&#8217;t become what you want, you become what you believe.&#8221;</em><br />\n&#8211; Oprah Winfrey</p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="size-full wp-image-34307 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/oprah-winfrey-quote.jpg" alt="oprah winfrey quote" width="550" height="461" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/oprah-winfrey-quote.jpg 550w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/oprah-winfrey-quote-400x335.jpg 400w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/oprah-winfrey-quote-501x420.jpg 501w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></p>\n<p>As you may have noticed, all these rules have something in common. They appeal to you on a personal level because success is an individual process.</p>\n<p>There are no limits when you don&#8217;t limit yourself.

It&#8217;s about learning genuine things about a\xa0place and its people.</p>\n<p>While there are various ways to achieve that, every method provides a different level of exposure to people. Some prefer to go around a place in groups wearing matching outfits and led by a tourist guide with a flag. On the other hand, there are people who prefer to be low-key tourists when traveling.</p>\n<p>Tourists must be at terms with the fact that they can never be locals when they are just visiting. This, however, doesn&#8217;t mean that they can&#8217;t experience a place as authentically as locals know it to be. To give you an idea, here are some tips to help\xa0you travel like a local.</p>\n<h3>Get to know the place in advance</h3>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34446 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/travel-research.jpg" alt="travel research" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/travel-research.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/travel-research-400x267.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>It is handy for travelers to go to the library or use Google to <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/pinterest-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">research about the place</a> they are planning to visit. Find blogs, reviews or comments from people who have been to the area and try to learn from their experiences. Knowing an area in advance is probably the most important preparation any traveler can do.</p>\n<h3>Don’t do a bus tour for the entire journey</h3>\n<p>If you really want to get more out of your trip, it&#8217;s best if you don&#8217;t fully rely on tours to take you everywhere that’s on your itinerary. Although bus tours are informative and entertaining, it will cause you to miss out on handling transactions on your own.</p>\n<p>Some might think that’s a good thing since negotiating with other people and dealing with foreign currencies is intimidating and confusing. With package tours, a tourist will need not worry about itineraries, meals, tickets, transportation and stops. What they just need to do is join the tour.</p>\n<h3>Make friends with a local</h3>\n<p>It is common for travelers to visit a foreign land and not know anyone from the place. It is also quite difficult to befriend a stranger there since there isn’t any assurance of their trustworthiness. Despite this, you should still give it a try. Like with any type of interaction, being open while remaining alert and cautious will help.</p>\n<p>Having a local friend is better than just going around with a tour guide. A local can help you find the best places in the area that can give you more than the usual tourist encounter.</p>\n<p>And even though the world can sometimes be a scary place for people who wander, keep in mind that there are still people who won&#8217;t hesitate to lend a hand.</p>\n<h3>Find a host family</h3>\n<p>Staying in a hotel will put you in an area with a high concentration of tourists. Although convenient, this will not give you a legitimate feel of the place.</p>\n<p>If you want to live like a local, even for just a short period, then you should consider living with the locals. As a solution, you can try looking for a host family. There are travel packages that can arrange your request. They will find willing and registered host families who can accommodate you while you&#8217;re in their area.</p>\n<p>If you find it difficult to meet a reliable host, your next best option is to look for an Airbnb rental or anything similar to that. This kind of arrangement will provide you the opportunity to interact with the locals better.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also:\xa0<a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/ways-to-travel-the-world-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">4 Smart Ways to Travel The World For Free</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Take the public transportation</h3>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34445 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/public-transportation.jpeg" alt="public transportation" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/public-transportation.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/public-transportation-400x267.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>Some countries have confusing and even risky public transportation. That is why it is best for travelers to get to know a place beforehand so that they can have a good idea on how to go about the city. After all, it is better to use public transportation if you really want to experience what locals do and how they go about their everyday lives.</p>\n<h3>Dress the part</h3>\n<p>Another important reminder for anyone traveling to a different country is to dress the part. Get a feel of how it is to live locally by wearing something that fits the environment and the culture.</p>\n<p>If a place is rather conservative, then dress conservatively. If it is alright to walk around the city in a\xa0plain t-shirt, a pair of slippers and shorts, then do that. Otherwise, a traveler would stick out of the crowd and look more like a tourist.</p>\n<h3>Learn key phrases and local customs</h3>\n<p>To facilitate better communication, learn some important local customs or even just a few words in the local tongue. Doing so will help you connect better to the people in the area.</p>\n<h2>Takeaway</h2>\n<p>Be ready to wander. Sometimes, it is good to take a little detour, change something in your itinerary, get lost a little or be spontaneous. Doing these things, however, does not mean you have to be reckless. Be cautious, but be ready to wander. That adds to the whole experience of traveling like a local.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also:\xa0<a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/strange-international-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">Strange International Laws Every Tourist Should Know</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/travel-like-a-local/" data-wpel-link="internal">7 Important Things To Do To Travel Like A Local</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com" data-wpel-link="internal">Dumb Little Man</a>.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DumbLittleMan/~4/3iU_H3fojIs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': {'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com'}], 'link': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com', 'href': 'http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y281/irw2003/dlmsmall.gif', 'title': 'Dumb Little Man', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/DumbLittleMan', 'value': 'Dumb Little Man'}}, 'enclosures': None}

The “boring life” of your dreams may just be the answer.</p>\n<h2>What is a “boring” dream life?</h2>\n<p>Simply put, it means living your life at a steady pace- not too fast or too slow. It means to counteract the exciting moments with the quiet, more “boring” ones. But, how exactly can you do that?</p>\n<p>Below are 5 ideas to help you get started.</p>\n<h3>Start a meditation practice</h3>\n<p>As someone who’s been meditating for 13+ years, meditation gives me time to process my experiences, think more clearly and make better choices.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21205" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/meditation-at-work.jpg" alt="meditation at work" width="600" height="352" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/meditation-at-work.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/meditation-at-work-400x235.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>When life at the office is stressful, my schedule is jam-packed with activities or I just feel too exhausted, meditation provides me the time to catch my breath and reflect.</p>\n<p>On a hot summer day, meditation is the cold glass of water that revitalizes me. It helps soften the blow of all the intense experiences, and it can do the same for you.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also: <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/questions-and-answers-beginners-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">Questions and Answers: A Beginners Guide to Meditation</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Schedule unscheduled time</h3>\n<p>Remember having more “free time” as a kid? You know, that block of time you were given at camp or some other event to do whatever you want? Unscheduled time is similar. It’s time where you don’t plan anything, and you can do whatever you feel.</p>\n<p>Unscheduled time is similar. It’s the time where you don’t plan anything, and you can do whatever you feel.</p>\n<p>The funny thing about unscheduled time is you have to schedule it—or it’s likely not to happen. Personally, I schedule it in two-hour blocks, and I leave one entire day a week (usually Sunday) as unscheduled.</p>\n<p>I never work on Sundays. Instead, I hang out with friends, explore the city with my girlfriend, catch a movie, exercise or simply do what I feel. And without fail, that one unscheduled day revitalizes me, recharging my batteries for the week ahead.</p>\n<h3>Chill out on the stimulants</h3>\n<p>Consuming booze, coffee, sugar and even fatty meals on a regular basis can have a dramatic effect on how you feel and your perspective.</p>\n<p>Too much coffee can leave you wired and irritable. Boozing frequently can keep you perpetually in hangover-recovery mode, and too much sugar can leave you feeling depleted.</p>\n<p>So, I recommend balancing your stimulants.</p>\n<p>Drink more water. Eat more fruits and veggies (with less butter and dressing), and don’t overdo it with the stimulants. Yes, these changes can be dreadfully boring, but your body and mind will surely thank you later.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also: <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/develop-healthy-eating-habits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">How To Develop Awesome Eating Habits Without Failing</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Stay grounded with habits</h3>\n<p>Personally, my habits help keep me sane. I meditate every day, exercise 2-4 times a week, eat 2 vegetarian meals a day and go to bed at 10 pm on weeknights. These habits make me feel like me, and they remind me of who I am.</p>\n<p>In other words, <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/daily-healthy-habits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">habits provide stability in your life</a>.</p>\n<p>They keep you planted when the going gets tough. If you have a bad day, your habit, whether that’s exercise, meditation, reading an hour in the evening, will be right there waiting for you. No matter how much the circumstances in your life change, your habits won’t. They can be your rock when life gets insane.</p>\n<h3>Balance your life</h3>\n<p>Last year, I took a total of 4 vacations, lasting a total of 6 and a half weeks, in the span of 5 months. How did that make me feel?</p>\n<p>Awesome at first but, by the last trip, I was sick of vacation. I felt unproductive and bored with the sights I was seeing.</p>\n<p>In hindsight, it’s obvious I overdid it. I should have spread out my vacation time more evenly throughout the year. If I had, I would have enjoyed the experiences a lot more.</p>\n<p>Whether it’s vacation, dining at nice restaurants or knocking back some beers with your buddies, I recommend adopting the same attitude in every area of your life. Don’t overdo it, and don’t underdo it. <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/work-life-balance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">Find a balance</a> between the quiet times and the exciting times so you can live the life of your dreams.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22903" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/vacation.jpg" alt="vacation" width="600" height="351" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/vacation.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/vacation-400x234.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>But, how do you find that balance?</p>\n<p>Well, that answer is for you to discover yourself. Experiment and find out what works best for you.</p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s a tip.</p>\n<p>If you feel like you’re overdoing it in one area of your life, ask yourself, “How does this make me feel? Does doing this activity so often make me happy?”. If the answer is “no”, then try cutting back on it to find a happier medium. You may just discover a new love for another activity.</p>\n<h2>The challenge of enjoying the “boring” dream life</h2>\n<p>There’s no use sugar-coating it.</p>\n<p>It can be scary to slow down, especially when your friends start to take notice. Some of them might think you’re acting weird and you may even lose some friendships along the way. Even worse, taking some quiet time for yourself may cause you anxiety.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>Well, you’re not used to it. And that’s okay.</p>\n<p>There’s no need to rush though. Take baby steps as you slow down towards the life of your dreams. Once you find time to breathe and balance the adrenaline with the quiet, I guarantee you’re going to feel 10x better. You’re going to enjoy time with friends. You can go out for vacations and parties to eat out and drink.</p>\n<p>Start today and take some time for yourself. Start a new habit, like meditating. Do whatever you need to do but just make sure you schedule some time for yourself.</p>\n<p>Put YOU first and ask yourself, “Will this activity make me happy?”. Let that question be your guide, and you’re sure to find yourself smiling a bit longer.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/life-of-your-dreams/" data-wpel-link="internal">How To Find The Boring Life Of Your Dreams</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com" data-wpel-link="internal">Dumb Little Man</a>.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DumbLittleMan/~4/CmAZJ-SvCj0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': {'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com'}], 'link': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com', 'href': 'http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y281/irw2003/dlmsmall.gif', 'title': 'Dumb Little Man', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/DumbLittleMan', 'value': 'Dumb Little Man'}}, 'enclosures': None}

Antioco rejected the proposal and ignorantly followed the path that eventually led to the closure of Blockbuster. Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, achieved success while Antioco missed the opportunity.</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34397" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blockbuster-stores.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="337" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blockbuster-stores.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blockbuster-stores-400x225.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>In 1999, Mark Cuban sold his publicly traded company, Broadcast.com, to Yahoo for $5.7 billion and proceeded to further expand his successful empire. By 2002, Yahoo shut down its broadcast services and also discontinued Broadcast.com. Cuban sold at what seems to be just the right time.</p>\n<p>Antioco and Cuban were successful businessmen at the time and each made an important move at a critical time in their businesses. Antioco’s move led to the eventual closure of Blockbuster and Cuban’s move further propelled his successful career as an entrepreneur.</p>\n<p>Those moves involved one thing: awareness. It&#8217;s a critical element in strong emotionally intelligent people. While emotional intelligence focuses on personal and social awareness, contextual awareness is just as important. The act of being aware can predict whether someone succeeds or fails in his career.</p>\n<h3>Awareness Exposes Past Shortcomings</h3>\n<p>Failure without learning is a missed opportunity.</p>\n<p>People who have the ability to recognize why and how the failure occurred in the past can gain insight into ways to grow. Unfortunately, failures or shortcomings are not always easy to identify.</p>\n<p>If you only chalk up failures as when something catastrophic happens in your life, you are going to miss on the opportunity to grow through them. Failures are priceless and far too many people would rather ignore failures in order to feel like they are successful.</p>\n<p>As much as possible, do not ignore your failures and use them instead. If you are more worried about being right or winning in all situations, you will miss those losing moments where experience has a valuable lesson to teach you.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also: <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/overcoming-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">5 Ways To Make The Most Of Failure</a></strong></p>\n<p>Push back from your present situation and reevaluate those moments where you messed up, where you did not meet up to standards or where you did not meet a goal. These are the failures that can leave you with a valuable set of lessons.</p>\n<p>Your awareness in the past will help you succeed in the future. Truthfully recognizing your past successes and failures will open the doors to a successful tomorrow.</p>\n<h3>Awareness Brightens Present Situations</h3>\n<p>Awareness has the ability to let you see your current situation accurately. With all the distractions fighting for your attention every day, it&#8217;s easy to feel overloaded and even burned out. They can stop you from seeing life clearly. And the less clarity you have, the harder it is to successfully pursue your dreams, plans and goals.</p>\n<p>Recognize your present situations, their benefits and consequences. The more awareness you have in the present, the better you&#8217;ll be in making decisions. <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/need-self-awareness-3-important-reasons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">Awareness</a> helps you decide what you should and shouldn&#8217;t pursue.

Without this present awareness, he might have missed the opportunity to sell high and build his empire off of his company being sold.</p>\n<p>John Antioco missed his current situation because he was blinded by his current success. Blockbuster was very successful when Reed Hastings approached Antioco, but Antioco didn’t see the true colors of Blockbuster’s present success. Blockbuster was making most of their money on people’s late fees and Hastings and Netflix eliminated this pain from customers. While Blockbuster was successful on other people’s failures to return their movies on time, Netflix grew in success because they solved customers’ problems.</p>\n<p>Do not be blind to your current situation. A true reality check will allow you to see if you are in a healthy situation or not.</p>\n<h3>Awareness Sheds Light Into The Future</h3>\n<p>People who can honestly identify past successes and failures and see their present situations accurately\xa0will have the advantage to see into the future. Things today are changing constantly and those who are able to identify the changing tides have the upper hand.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also:\xa0<a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/maximize-your-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">How To Maximize Your Potential While Embracing Your Weaknesses</a></strong></p>\n<p>A surfer, for example, will sit in the water to wait out on his desired wave. He must be aware of the movement of water and the timing of the wave before he jumps. That is awareness.</p>\n<p>Mark Cuban didn’t miss his success wave. In fact, he caught it just in time.</p>\n<h3>Awareness Will Predict Your Future Success or Failure</h3>\n<p>Step back and exercise your ability to be aware of yourself, your relationships, social environment and context. The stronger your awareness of the past, present and future, the greater your chances of being successful.</p>\n<p>Use awareness in business to learn lessons, measure conditions and plan for growth.

Try this new lullaby: <em>“Netflix and chill / kill the cable bill.”</em></p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34381" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/netflix.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="337" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/netflix.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/netflix-400x225.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also:\xa0<a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/cheap-tv-alternatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">5 Ways to Cut Down on Your TV Costs</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Add 25%</h3>\n<p>Remember that everything you buy is bought with after-tax income, meaning that you should add 25% to account for your tax bracket. 25% is easy math, even if it’s not your bracket. Keeping this in mind can only help you cut spending.</p>\n<h3>Timing</h3>\n<p>Most things have some element of timing built into the price. Restaurants with happy hours or special deals, stores offering time-sensitive deals, vacation spots with off-season discounts&#8230;you get the idea. Use it to your advantage.</p>\n<h3>Lifestyle creep</h3>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-34380 size-full" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/luxury-goods.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/luxury-goods.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/luxury-goods-400x267.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>Avoid it. Stay away from spending more on luxury goods, like high-end gadgets or designer clothing just because you can. That’s a good way to end up owing more than you own and spending more than you keep. It&#8217;s what you keep that will matter more.</p>\n<h3>Save more than 10%</h3>\n<p>No matter your income, you’ll likely thank yourself later in life for saving more now. Compound interest needs time to work in your favor, and you need to give it a push. It’s commonly recommended to save 10%, but I see this as insufficient in a world of longer lifetimes, potentially lengthier retirements and rising healthcare costs. Try to save more if you can.</p>\n<h3>Keep the network alive</h3>\n<p>This relates more to advancing in your career than it does saving money, but <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/5-killer-hacks-for-networking-at-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">staying connected with people </a>you’ve known in the past or work with now can only help you.

Everything that exists contains this flow of energy. It’s always there. When you are in that flow, you know that you are safe. You know you can do anything. You know that everything\xa0will go well and everything will work out.</p>\n<p>There are no mistakes when you’re in the flow. You can’t do anything wrong.</p>\n<p>It’s kind of like being in that make-believe world we had as children where we could do anything we set our minds to and nothing could ever go awry.</p>\n<p>That’s what being in the flow is like.</p>\n<h6>We are designed to live in the flow. We are designed to live our lives as powerful beings.</h6>\n<h2>Unfortunately, our minds get in the way</h2>\n<p>Our minds live in the physical world. Our minds need PROOF. Our minds KNOW&#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8230;that we’re individuals</p>\n<p>&#8230;we&#8217;re not connected to everyone else</p>\n<p>&#8230;we’re separate</p>\n<p>&#8230;other people are dangerous</p>\n<p>&#8230;mistakes are wrong and bad and we must avoid making them or other people will think we’re really stupid</p>\n<p>&#8230;we measure success by comparing ourselves with others</p>\n<p>We live in a world created by our mind.</p>\n<h2>The Subtlety of Our Intuition</h2>\n<p>Our minds are so loud that we often miss what our higher self is trying to tell us because our higher self is very subtle, very gentle. In fact, it&#8217;s the complete opposite of how the mind is!</p>\n<p>Our higher self might give us a nudge to go in a different direction when we think that we absolutely know the way. Synchronicities and coincidences map out the path that our higher self is guiding us along.</p>\n<p>The difference between the way the mind works and the way our higher self works is like trying to compare Las Vegas and Vienna. You can bet your bottom dollar that the path our higher self will take us on will be the quickest and most beneficial one for us in more ways than we can possibly imagine.</p>\n<p>Our higher self gives little nudges:<em> ‘take the next left turn’</em> or <em>&#8216;call Sam&#8217;</em> whom you haven’t seen in ages. Before we know it, something completely unexpected happens. It&#8217;s like landing on a ladder square in snakes and ladders: we bypass three rows of squares and catapult forwards.</p>\n<p>Can you remember how it feels when that happens in snakes and ladders? You’re way behind everyone else then you land on a ladder square and suddenly, you’re in the first place and way AHEAD of everyone else?</p>\n<p>You feel amazing: light, happy, gleeful, joyous.</p>\n<p>Anything and everything become possible.</p>\n<p>That’s how life SHOULD feel. You SHOULD feel happy, joyful, excited, safe, loved ALL THE TIME.</p>\n<p>You’re meant to live your life IN THAT FLOW of energy.</p>\n<p>But to do that, you must quieten the mind down to the point where you can hear those intuitive nudges.</p>\n<p>Which is easier said than done, to be honest, because the purpose of the mind is to protect you.</p>\n<p>And really, all it wants to do is to keep us safe from harm. It works to be KIND to your mind, to not judge it and to understand where it’s coming from.</p>\n<p>The more you resist what your mind is trying to do, the louder it’s going to become.</p>\n<p>Give your mind a break: its job is to protect you.</p>\n<h2>Quieten The Mind To Hear Your Intuition</h2>\n<p>Having said that, how can we quieten our minds to the point at least where we can hear our intuition?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Doing something physically strenuous will usually get your mind to calm down: e.g. running, swimming, boxing or an aerobics class.</li>\n<li>Doing yoga</li>\n<li>Meditating</li>\n<li>Journaling</li>\n<li>Visualising</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Find a method that you can do DAILY to help calm your mind to the point where you can at least HEAR the nudges from your intuition.</p>\n<p>Get into the habit of listening out for those nudges. Look for synchronicities, the coincidences, the little hints and suggestions…</p>\n<p>And then, FOLLOW them! Now you can hear them, FOLLOW THEM! Don’t ignore them!</p>\n<p>When you get one of those nudges, it’s like landing on the ladder square: take advantage of it!</p>\n<p>If you were playing snakes and ladders and you couldn’t see where the ladder was heading, you STILL wouldn’t hesitate to take the ladder square, would you?</p>\n<p>You wouldn’t take another turn just in case you ended up somewhere you didn’t want to?</p>\n<p>You wouldn’t take another roll of the dice just because you couldn’t see what was at the end of the ladder…</p>\n<p>Because you’d KNOW that the ladder was heading UPWARDS and by taking it, you’re going to end up that much closer to the end square.</p>\n<h2>Your higher self wants you to win</h2>\n<p>It wants you to have everything you’ve ever dreamed of.</p>\n<p>You just need to listen to it when it’s talking to you.</p>\n<p>Try thanking your mind kindly for its input, give it a big hug, quieten it down and listen out for those nudges from your higher self and follow where they’re leading.</p>\n<p>You will end up somewhere completely unexpected and more amazing than where you planned to be!</p>\n<p>And I&#8217;d love to hear where that is!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/how-to-listen-to-your-intuition/" data-wpel-link="internal">Do You Drown Out Your Intuition?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com" data-wpel-link="internal">Dumb Little Man</a>.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DumbLittleMan/~4/LhcXdRhl5Fg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': {'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com'}], 'link': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com', 'href': 'http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y281/irw2003/dlmsmall.gif', 'title': 'Dumb Little Man', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/DumbLittleMan', 'value': 'Dumb Little Man'}}, 'enclosures': None}

It allows them to determine their own future and to shape their own destiny. That is what we all crave for. Yet, somewhere along the way, we have lost touch of this freedom we all love. We now struggle with our own minds.</p>\n<p>If you are struggling to take control of your life, here&#8217;s what you need to know.</p>\n<h3>What many people are doing</h3>\n<p>Most people get influenced by the world around them. This can be intentional or unintentional, but it keeps them from being fully in control of themselves. They don’t have the power to make the most out of their day. They cannot stick to the choices they make.</p>\n<p>People go along with these influences like they are normal. Instead of being in full control of themselves, they have given up their freedom to things and people which should not matter to them.</p>\n<h3>Why it matters</h3>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34312 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/internet-influenced.jpg" alt="internet influenced" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/internet-influenced.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/internet-influenced-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>These scenarios happen countless times every day and most people don’t realize their extent.</p>\n<p>Instead of playing with their kids, parents are influenced into placing a football bet after watching a TV advertisement. Employees browse aimlessly on the internet, instead of working. Instead of working on their business, aspiring entrepreneurs are busy scrolling on Facebook after receiving a few notifications.</p>\n<p>If you are one of those people, you need to wake up and take control of your life. You aren’t living on your terms and you are being influenced by things to such an extent that you aren’t a free man anymore.</p>\n<h3>What you can do</h3>\n<p>An acknowledgment of this is a good first step, but most people don’t even go that far. They continue to live their lives depending on other people&#8217;s approval. They don’t even realize that they have a choice and they let other people control their happiness.</p>\n<p>Modern society considers this as normal. Isn’t this absurd?</p>\n<p>Many people are still fighting for political freedom to this day, yet many of our actions aren’t done through our own control. People should fight for freedom, and the freedom we can most control is the freedom within ourselves. No one should influence our choices in life.</p>\n<p>We must protect what we have, especially what we can control. We do not have power over many things external to us, and we can accept that and continue living happily. But, we shouldn’t be so weak and give up our control of what can’t physically be taken away from us.</p>\n<p>After all, political freedom won’t mean much if one’s own mind isn’t free. If we cannot control our mind, then we can&#8217;t expect ourselves to fully enjoy a life based on our own terms.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34313 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/importance-of-freedom.jpeg" alt="importance of freedom" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/importance-of-freedom.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/importance-of-freedom-400x266.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>The worst part of this is that this is all self-inflicted. There isn’t an enemy this time- just ourselves.</p>\n<p>And we shouldn&#8217;t be our own enemy. We should be in full control of how we live our lives.</p>\n<p>Many ordinary people will agree with this article, but right after they are finished reading it, they will go back on Facebook, their phones and pondering things that aren&#8217;t really important. The reality is that it takes great\xa0effort to get rid of these temptations, especially if it&#8217;s not in your true interest.</p>\n<p>Bear in mind, however, that you have a choice to reclaim your freedom and take control of your life.</p>\n<p>Strong people can easily agree to this. They know that they are in full control and nothing or nobody else has power over them. These people have the authority over their lives and they will do what they want. They will not cave into societies’ influences.</p>\n<p>These things are great examples for other people, especially those who have lost their way and those who are currently unhappy with their lives.</p>\n<p>Embrace change if you need it. Your freedom is one of your most prized possessions, so don’t take it for granted. When one realizes that he might have lost his way, then they need to fight back for it. Freedom is never worth giving up.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/take-control-of-your-life/" data-wpel-link="internal">The Importance Of Freedom And How To Take Control Of Your Life</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com" data-wpel-link="internal">Dumb Little Man</a>.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DumbLittleMan/~4/HVqmexwmzks" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': {'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com'}], 'link': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com', 'href': 'http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y281/irw2003/dlmsmall.gif', 'title': 'Dumb Little Man', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/DumbLittleMan', 'value': 'Dumb Little Man'}}, 'enclosures': None}
{'title': 'How To Develop Empathy By Understanding Subjective Hardship', 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DumbLittleMan/~3/tfF7Ax-OkgQ/', 'author': 'Duane Rohrbacher', 'date': '2017.04.28', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/DumbLittleMan', 'value': '<p>Most people understand what hardship is but not a lot of people know how to develop empathy. When we think about someone who undergoes hardship, we often think about those who are impoverished, disabled or marginalized in some way. What we fail to think about is subjective hardship.</p>\n<h3>What is subjective hardship?</h3>\n<p>I define subjective hardship as the hardship that someone internalizes. Often, we cannot see these hardships. But, just because we cannot see them, does not mean that they are not real. Just because someone might seem fine on the outside, does not mean that person is not having real pain on the inside.</p>\n<p>If a child from a high-income household expects hundreds of presents each year, and one year that child receives less than expected, there is a good chance that child will be undergoing subjective hardship.</p>\n<p>Now, you might be thinking that this spoiled kid is not undergoing any hardship and that&#8217;s exactly the problem. The number of people who take their lives has increased in recent years. High schools and colleges are seeing a major increase in mental health issues across young people who are 14 to 24 years old.</p>\n<p>Many of the reasons that these numbers are increasing revolve around how we conceptualize hardship. We have to reframe how we think about hardship to better understand what factors are leading to the increase in mental health service use.</p>\n<h3>Developing empathy for hardship</h3>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34305 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/active-listening.jpeg" alt="active listening" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/active-listening.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/active-listening-400x266.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>One of the best ways to understand how people conceptualize subjective hardship is to listen. Active listening is the key. Simply listening to someone who is going through some form of hardship, without judgment, could make all the difference. When we fail to account for subjective hardship, we forget that we are human.</p>\n<p>Humans live and die by the expectations they create for their society, community, and families. If all of a sudden, we change someone&#8217;s paradigm, that person is likely to struggle with his or her mental and physical health. On the outside, that person may own a fancy house and car, but, on the inside, that person could be struggling with depression, anxiety, and stress.</p>\n<h3>Break down the barriers through vulnerability</h3>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34304 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/break-down-barriers.jpg" alt="break down barriers" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/break-down-barriers.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/break-down-barriers-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>The easiest way to break down a barrier is to acknowledge. If someone you know seems a little off, say something.</p>\n<p>There are so many reasons why we experience pain in life. However, because we feel like no one will be able to understand the pain and what we are going through, we often hide them.That attitude is the barrier that we need to break down. Other people will only be able to understand you if you let them in.</p>\n<p>Showing vulnerability is the easiest way to get another person to open up to you. If I tell you about how my life is going and the struggles that I face, you will be more likely to open up to me. Showing vulnerability is showing strength as it takes strength to admit when something is wrong.</p>\n<p>If we can break down the barriers and realize that people are just people, then we might be able to save some lives.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Hardship is both objective and subjective.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of data on objective hardship which enable us to know exactly how to combat it. What we know less about and what we need to learn more about is subjective hardship.</p>\n<p>No one has a perfect life. Because we place such a high value on money and material possessions, we often forget how important personal relationships, health, and moods are. No one deserves constant stress, anxiety or sadness. It is the right time\xa0that we step up and show empathy for others.</p>\n<p>The simplest way to show empathy is to listen to someone&#8217;s problems. Ask about what&#8217;s going on in their lives. Try kindness and aim to develop trust.</p>\n<p>There is a good chance that person will return the favor in the future. If we can break down our barriers, we can develop relationships across socioeconomic boundaries. Be just a little better than you were yesterday and see what happens.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/how-to-develop-empathy/" data-wpel-link="internal">How To Develop Empathy By Understanding Subjective Hardship</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com" data-wpel-link="internal">Dumb Little Man</a>.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DumbLittleMan/~4/tfF7Ax-OkgQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': {'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com'}], 'link': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com', 'href': 'http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y281/irw2003/dlmsmall.gif', 'title': 'Dumb Little Man', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/DumbLittleMan', 'value': 'Dumb Little Man'}}, 'enclosures': None}

We know the big things that will make our lives better, but the fact that they’re big tasks means they can feel daunting or overwhelming.</p>\n<p>And so we easily give up on them.</p>\n<p>Life isn’t always about big, bold milestones. It’s also about the little things that can bring you a more positive and fulfilling lifestyle.</p>\n<p>If you feel the same way, then you should know that there are small positive changes you can still do to make your life better. Pick one thing from the list below and test it out. If you like it and it&#8217;s becoming a regular habit, add another one in.</p>\n<p>And the best thing about these small changes? They require no extra money or prep time.</p>\n<p>So, what are you waiting for? Scroll down the list, pick a number and\xa0start making positive changes.</p>\n<h3>17 Things That Will Bring You Positive Changes</h3>\n<p>1. Get up and go to bed at the same time every day as much as you can. However, a spontaneous wild night out every now and then won’t hurt anyone.</p>\n<p>2. Watch some comedy every day to keep those laughter muscles warmed up.</p>\n<p>3. Have a healthy breakfast to set yourself up well for the day. Oatmeal with fruits, a smoothie or even a homemade granola will do.</p>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-28741 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/healthy-breakfast.jpg" alt="healthy breakfast" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/healthy-breakfast.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/healthy-breakfast-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>4. Consider playing the songs you love as you’re getting ready in the morning. It will give your day a great start even before you leave the house.</p>\n<p>5. Unfollow people on Facebook. A major factor in feeling bad is comparing ourselves to other people. Seeing your high school buddy’s “perfect” holiday,\xa0kids or home isn’t going to boost your self-esteem. It&#8217;s best to remove them from your view.</p>\n<p>6.\xa0Do something you&#8217;ve always wanted to do but haven&#8217;t had the time for. Make it simple and achievable, like dining at a particular restaurant or trying out a new recipe.</p>\n<p>7. While you’re lying in bed at night, think of five things that went well that day. They don’t have to be big or dramatic. It can be a nice lunch, a free gift at the store or a cute baby that smiled at you. As a result, you&#8217;ll be able to train your brain to focus on the good rather than the bad.</p>\n<p>8. Talk back to your negative thoughts. If your friend told you she’d had an unproductive day, would you\xa0respond negatively or positively? Consider it the same for yourself. Being harsh on yourself won&#8217;t help you achieve more. In fact, it can only make you feel crappy.</p>\n<p>9. Keep a notebook and jot down all the things that make you feel alive. You’d be amazed at how this simple act can switch your brain into feeling good.</p>\n<p>10. At least once a week, wear an outfit that makes you feel great. Wear your most fabulous clothes, underwear included. Do your hair in a style you love, put on some makeup, and head out looking good. You&#8217;ll be amazed at how differently people will treat you.</p>\n<p>11. Send a text once a week to someone you know and tell them why you think they’re awesome. This will boost your positivity.</p>\n<p>12. If you want to work out but can’t find the motivation, just go for a walk. It’s better than nothing and will get your blood pumping. The best way to get fit is to see yourself as someone who works out and keeps fit.</p>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34233 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/walking-exercise.jpeg" alt="walking exercise" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/walking-exercise.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/walking-exercise-400x266.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>13. Drop the word “should”. Keep an eye out for how often you say it and ask yourself if it’s making you feel better or worse. Is it something genuinely important to you? Who said you should do it? Do they know you better than you know yourself? Ask yourself these questions and you&#8217;ll know why the word won&#8217;t help you.</p>\n<p>14. If you’re a procrastinator, introduce the <a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/productivity-hacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">“yucky task, nice task”</a> process. It works just as it sounds. Get your yucky task done first and give yourself a reward or do a nicer task after.</p>\n<p>15. Another positive change you can do is clear your inbox of all the newsletters you’re signed up to. Put them in a separate folder, delete them, or pare them down to just the ones you love to receive. The feeling of freedom that comes from an uncluttered inbox is worth more than the sporadic, fleeting bonus you might get from one of your newsletters.</p>\n<p>16. Add one more piece of fruit into your day and mix it up with the usual ones you have every day. Make it a daily challenge to see the different kinds of fruit you can eat. In addition to helping you start with some positive changes, it can also help you be healthier.</p>\n<p>17. Finally, if you’re a news junkie, set a timer and allow yourself to read the news for an allotted period of time only. Our news has changed over the past few years and they&#8217;re designed to hook you in. Generally, we feel worse after watching story upon story of terror and bad news, so limit your exposure. If you’re not a news junkie, why not take a break from watching?</p>\n<p>So, there you have it. These are the 17 small changes that can add up to big results.

I was terrified to go into the other room, where other kids were whacking a piñata with a long stick. That model followed me the rest of my life.</p>\n<p>Being an unconfident male in America is not a winning recipe for success and I knew that. For decades, I had no clue what to do to get out of it. At times, I felt doomed to a life of misery, despair, and loneliness.</p>\n<p>But that wasn’t acceptable. I couldn’t live with that defining my life. Even though I felt completely annihilated, I figured a way out must exist. Otherwise, life won’t even be worth living.</p>\n<p>And today, as a young 34-year-old man, I’ve got all the confidence in the world despite things being rough at the moment. My wife and I have $30,000+ in medical debt (and growing) and she has perplexing health problems that baffle doctors.</p>\n<p>I have every reason to feel anxious and fearful and yet I&#8217;m not. I’m certainly not perfect, so fear and doubt creep in from time-to-time. But, I’m happier and more joyful than ever before. And if you met me, you’d think things are going quite well.</p>\n<p>If you are wondering how I started building confidence, here are a few lessons I learned along the way:</p>\n<h3>Consider Your Mind A Dangerous Place You Never Go Alone</h3>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34230 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/dangerous-mind.jpeg" alt="dangerous mind" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/dangerous-mind.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/dangerous-mind-400x266.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>Remember your parents telling you,<em>”Never go near that place. It’s dangerous. You could get hurt.”</em></p>\n<p>What happens in your mind? If you’re a fearful person, you&#8217;ll notice the thoughts start buzzing. Although you try not to think about them, they still gain power. You tell yourself not to act on them, but you still find yourself doing that.</p>\n<p>And often, you feel completely overwhelmed and defeated. Fear runs your life. You don’t talk to people you want to. You don’t ask women for dates. You don’t leave the house, even though you want to.</p>\n<p>True, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>That’s exactly how I handled fear for a long time and I got the same old results — more fear. Failure after failure made me feel trapped and at a dead end. I felt stumped, defeated and totally lost.</p>\n<p>That’s why I no longer hide anything or live in my mi-nd anymore. I had to constantly practice sharing my thinking with others whom I trust to listen without judgment. I keep pouring those fearful thoughts out of my head so they won&#8217;t have an opportunity to grow and gain strength.</p>\n<h3>You Can Only Neglect the Spiritual Dimension of Your Life to Your Detriment</h3>\n<p>To cope with my fear, shame, guilt and poor self-esteem, I developed an addiction. The addiction took my naturally fearful disposition and magnified its intensity 100 times.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I learned the spiritual part of life had to come first. It’s kept me out of my addiction and it’s transformed me from fearful to confident.</p>\n<p>Spiritually, I simply trust that all will work out and everything is under the control of a supreme God. That gives me the confidence that all I have to do is continue to grow as a person and keep trying. Something will work out. I don’t know what or when, but I know it will.</p>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34229 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/spiritual-confidence.jpeg" alt="spiritual confidence" width="600" height="450" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/spiritual-confidence.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/spiritual-confidence-400x300.jpeg 400w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/spiritual-confidence-80x60.jpeg 80w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/spiritual-confidence-265x198.jpeg 265w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/spiritual-confidence-560x420.jpeg 560w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/spiritual-confidence-80x60@2x.jpeg 160w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/spiritual-confidence-265x198@2x.jpeg 530w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>Can you gain confidence without spirituality? Perhaps. But, I think it’s like not taking vitamin C when you have a cold. You can do other things (like rest). But you’re throwing away a key part of the puzzle.</p>\n<h3>Have an Insane Desire to Serve Others</h3>\n<p>My natural fear kept me withdrawn and isolated. The addiction made it even worse that coming out became impossible.</p>\n<p>But, as I learned what worked, it became clear that serving others was the key. When I thought about my fear, I realized how self-focused it made me.</p>\n<p>These are the thoughts that would often cross my mind:</p>\n<p>• What’s that person thinking of me?<br />\n• Oh no, I did something wrong.<br />\n• What should I say?<br />\n• Will I fail?<br />\n• I’m an idiot.</p>\n<p>If you ever find yourself constantly thinking about these things, get out of that thinking. I actually started this right away before feeling confident. Although I knew I didn&#8217;t have the confidence or skills to accomplish large things, I knew could deal with the smaller stuff.</p>\n<p>I didn’t just serve others by volunteering to serve soup at a homeless shelter once a month. It’s actually a daily practice. When a friend calls, I pick up immediately. If someone asks for help, I say “Yes” 90% of the time.</p>\n<p>Whenever someone has a small problem,\xa0I clarify it for them. A friend wakes me up at 6:30 in the morning with a phone call, I answer right away, rather than calling back at a more convenient time.</p>\n<h3>Identify Your Own Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>\n<p>Building confidence comes from knowing yourself. Just like everyone else, you have strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>I always thought confidence means appearing invulnerable, like Superman. You have no weaknesses and you never feel afraid.</p>\n<p>In reality, however, that’s just trying to stuff feelings and it only increased my fear.</p>\n<p>When you’re trapped in fear, you falsely believe you have more weaknesses than strengths. It prevents you from seeing yourself accurately.</p>\n<p>But, take a look. You&#8217;ll be pleasantly surprised with what you&#8217;ll find. You&#8217;ll realize that as you learn how to deal with your fear, you’ll find you have more good parts which you didn’t know you had.</p>\n<p>The good parts of you will grow while the bad and negative will fall away and become much less apparent in your life.</p>\n<p>That’s how it worked for me. I couldn’t have done it without looking at the bad (greedy, critical, demanding) and good (intelligent, helpful, funny). And today, I feel like I’m 95% the good version of me. You can ask my friends, my wife, and even strangers, and they’d say positive things about me.</p>\n<h3>Only Focus on What You Can Control</h3>\n<p>Historically, so much of my fear has been based on outcomes of situations. I want to:</p>\n<p>• Have people respond my way<br />\n• Always win<br />\n• Never have any rough patches<br />\n• Be a fearless superhero winner like James Bond</p>\n<p>When I didn’t get the desired outcomes, I beat myself up and felt guilty and ashamed. Clearly, because I didn’t get the woman, the job, the friend, or the money, I was a “bad” person.</p>\n<p>I rarely do that anymore, because about 90% of life doesn’t work out your way.<br />\nOnly 10% does. So, focus on that 10% and grow the heck out of it. Keep trying until you find what works and do less of what doesn’t.</p>\n<p>In a given day, I can’t control much. I’m self-employed. I can only control how and when I reach out to prospective clients, and how many of them I contact. Whether they choose to do business with me or not isn’t in my control.</p>\n<p>So, I can only make contacts and chat with interested prospects. After that, I just have to trust that everything falls into place.</p>\n<p>In the grand scheme of things, I realized that isn’t much.</p>\n<h3>Understand The Paradoxical Ways Your Mind Works</h3>\n<p>Human minds sometimes work the opposite of what appears to make sense. For example, if you have ever said to yourself, ”I’m going to walk right up to that girl and ask her for her phone number” and then promptly avoided doing it, you’ve probably felt confused as to why.</p>\n<p>Well, it’s because you’re using willpower but you don’t have enough confidence. You still feel fearful and it shows most of the time.</p>\n<p>So, the first paradox is this:</p>\n<p>• To overcome your fear, let it enter</p>\n<p>I no longer say to myself, ”Uh-oh. I’m getting fearful again. Don’t do it. Don’t do it. Don’t do it…Oh no! Here it is. I’m screwed. This is gonna be rough.”</p>\n<p>Instead, I allow the fear to enter. Whenever it comes in, I feel numbness and tingling in my arms. My hands sweat a little. My back and neck tighten up.</p>\n<p>However, I don’t get fearful of those sensations. I let them happen.\xa0I know they&#8217;ll pass and I&#8217;ll be alright. And that diminishes the power fear has over me.</p>\n<p>Other paradoxes include:</p>\n<p>• You get what you give<br />\n• Seek to understand to be understood<br />\n• Listen to others and you’ll be heard<br />\n• You get what you oppose<br />\n• Do it because you don’t want to<br />\n• Embrace your vulnerability</p>\n<h3>Feelings Often Don’t Fit the Facts</h3>\n<p>My wife of nearly 8 years and I met online. We talked a few times by phone before meeting. And once, I said something to her which I later thought was quite rude.</p>\n<p>I panicked. I thought I had blown it and she would never talk to me again.</p>\n<p>I’ve shared the story with her several times. I no longer remember her exact response, but she can’t recall anything unusual from our phone conversations.</p>\n<p>However, she does recall the awkwardness of our first date. She thought I was a cheapskate because we went to a friend’s house for dinner, then to a local zoo by the lake (free), and then watched a horror movie (rented) at home.</p>\n<p>Seemed fine to me since I thought it made sense to keep it casual when meeting the first time. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not what she was expecting.</p>\n<p>Anyway, my feelings told me I had ruined our relationship before it started. Then they told me the date was fine.</p>\n<p>In both cases, my feelings were different than reality.</p>\n<p>So today, if I’m feeling anxious, fearful, or wondering how I did or how to take what someone said, I don’t spend too much time thinking about it. I simply move on to what’s next and focus on that.</p>\n<p>And if I’m having a hard time with feelings that refuse to go away, I talk to someone else.</p>\n<h2>Yes, You Can Skyrocket Your Confidence, Too</h2>\n<p>You may, like me, have been born with low self-confidence. You may also have had catastrophic life experiences which ruined the confidence you have had.</p>\n<p>Well, you can get your confidence back. Or find it for the first time.</p>\n<p>No matter how stressful or intimidating it can be, you can absolutely learn how to feel confident in any situation. That can happen even if you don’t have a shred of confidence now.</p>\n<p>These tips can make that possible. But, of course, it will still be up to you to take action.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/building-confidence/" data-wpel-link="internal">How To Start Building Confidence: A Story From A (Formerly) Fearful Guy</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com" data-wpel-link="internal">Dumb Little Man</a>.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DumbLittleMan/~4/MJm-iY0mOec" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': {'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com'}], 'link': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com', 'href': 'http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y281/irw2003/dlmsmall.gif', 'title': 'Dumb Little Man', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/DumbLittleMan', 'value': 'Dumb Little Man'}}, 'enclosures': None}

If you think about it for a moment, you&#8217;ll realize that people who are truly successful don&#8217;t shy away from their weaknesses. In fact, they are alright sharing them.</p>\n<p>As a leader (which I believe you are), it will actually inspire those around you if they see you succeed in spite of your weaknesses. It will give them the courage to be better as well as to press on.</p>\n<p>To help you figure things out, here&#8217;s how to maximize your potential.</p>\n<h2>Why peace is essential</h2>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34225 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sense-of-peace.jpeg" alt="sense of peace" width="600" height="398" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sense-of-peace.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/sense-of-peace-400x265.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to feel like you are climbing uphill as you work on maximizing your potential. You can actually get a sense of peace when you come to terms with a skill that doesn&#8217;t come naturally to you. It will help you attain the patience needed to make progress.</p>\n<p>With that feeling of frustration off of your shoulders, you can focus more on how you can start working on your goal.</p>\n<h2>How weaknesses trump strengths</h2>\n<p>Your weaknesses can teach you more about how to work with people and the importance of cooperation. It&#8217;s also a place where growth can feel very rewarding.</p>\n<p>The right relationship with your weaknesses will allow you to focus more energy on maximizing your potential. Essentially, you&#8217;ll be able to achieve success faster when you are able to do this. In addition to figuring out what you are not good at by the process of elimination, you&#8217;ll be able to know what you are really good at.</p>\n<p>Remember, focusing solely on your strengths can be detrimental to you. You might miss out on the opportunity to grow.</p>\n<h2>How to handle reaching a plateau with a weakness</h2>\n<p>Investing in things you are naturally good at should not be an excuse to avoid things that don&#8217;t come naturally to you. Bear in mind, however, that when you do invest in improving on a weakness, you are likely to hit a plateau.</p>\n<p>So, what do you do?</p>\n<p>This is where you change things up. Changing your approach can raise the ceiling in your area of assumed weakness.</p>\n<p>As Gary Keller, in his #1 bestseller book entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ONE-Thing-Surprisingly-Extraordinary-Results/dp/1885167776/?tag=dlmus-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">The One Thing</a>, said,\xa0<em>&#8220;Natural ability can only take us so far before we hit our achievement ceiling. Models and Systems will help you break through that ceiling of achievement.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>You may never be a world-class lumberjack, but a chainsaw will take you further than an axe. Trying a new approach may be what you need.</p>\n<p>A University of Florida basketball player, Canyon Barry, used an unconventional underhand free throw style to hit 42 shots in a row, setting a school record.</p>\n<p>You might not look cool to some using a different approach to raise the ceiling of a weakness, but who cares. Just keep hitting your own free throws.</p>\n<h3>Just because it doesn’t come naturally to you doesn&#8217;t mean it’s a weakness</h3>\n<p>Most things don&#8217;t come naturally. They need to be learned. If you are struggling, maybe the issue is with your learning and not your innate ability.</p>\n<p>This is where a growth mindset (believing that most basic abilities can be developed) over a fixed mindset (believing that things like intelligence or talent are fixed traits) really makes a huge difference.</p>\n<p>As Carol S. Dweck said in her book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322/?tag=dlmus-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Mindset</a>,\xa0<em>&#8220;In the growth mindset, experiencing difficulty simply indicates the need to put in more effort. In the fixed mindset, difficulty means you do not have the\xa0ability.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>A reader who wrote to her also commented the following:</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;We should be careful not to view failure as a proof of stupidity but rather as a lack of knowledge, skill or experience which can all be remedied&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Can you raise the ceiling of that assumed weakness with a different learning approach and mindset? Think about it.</p>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34224 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/facing-weaknesses.jpeg" alt="facing weaknesses" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/facing-weaknesses.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/facing-weaknesses-400x266.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<h3>The one thing worse than a weakness</h3>\n<p>The real thing that is going to hold you back is your bad habits. I believe that is the one thing that&#8217;s likely to determine your success. It&#8217;s not hard to see how bad habits can dampen your strengths and amplify your weaknesses.</p>\n<p>A key element to embracing our weakness is facing those accompanying bad habits head on. It will not only help you raise the ceiling on a weakness, but it&#8217;s likely to boost your strengths, too.</p>\n<h2>Ready to maximize your potential?</h2>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t feel good to know you are living below your potential. Mediocrity is not a crown to be worn proudly. Although it&#8217;s true that some things don&#8217;t come naturally to you, it doesn&#8217;t mean that they have to hold you back.</p>\n<p>Freely admit your weaknesses and be transparent with them. Embrace the peace that comes with that decision and don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for help. If you feel like your progress is slowing down, it&#8217;s when you change things up. Just believe that you can raise the ceiling of that weakness.</p>\n<p>Be sure to kick those bad habits and just go maximize your potential!</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/maximize-your-potential/" data-wpel-link="internal">How To Maximize Your Potential While Embracing Your Weaknesses</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com" data-wpel-link="internal">Dumb Little Man</a>.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DumbLittleMan/~4/wh3ghF2ggos" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': {'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com'}], 'link': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com', 'href': 'http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y281/irw2003/dlmsmall.gif', 'title': 'Dumb Little Man', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/DumbLittleMan', 'value': 'Dumb Little Man'}}, 'enclosures': None}

Well, think again.\xa0What women look for in a man is more than good looks.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to have it all together in order to find a great match, but there are some resounding qualities that can put you ahead of the competition.</p>\n<p>Here are five traits\xa0you can improve on to impress the woman you like.</p>\n<h3>Someone who can make them laugh</h3>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34220 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/man-with-sense-of-humor.jpeg" alt="man with sense of humor" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/man-with-sense-of-humor.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/man-with-sense-of-humor-400x266.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>A good sense of humor tops the list for a lot of women. Having the ability to make light of a situation or crack a joke can help relieve stress and shows that you don’t take yourself too seriously. Humor in a relationship can also help break down tension and help the two of you navigate through life more harmoniously.</p>\n<h3>A sense of purpose</h3>\n<p>What women look for in a man is the passion and purpose in life and the drive to pursue it. A sense of ambition means that a partner cares about their future and isn’t satisfied with staying stagnant. Someone who cares about life and improving himself is much more exciting than someone who is comfortable in where he is.</p>\n<h3>Good communication skills</h3>\n<p>If you want to have a successful relationship, then you have to develop good communication skills. Misunderstanding is the number one factor that leads to fights in relationships.</p>\n<p>Good communication skills involve knowing how to listen to your partner as well as being able to express how you feel. Yelling or shouting at each other won’t get you anywhere, so it’s important to learn how to discuss things in a calm, effective manner.</p>\n<h3>Taking care of yourself</h3>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34219 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/man-cooking.jpg" alt="man cooking" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/man-cooking.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/man-cooking-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>Most women want a man who is a grown up and acts like one. They like men who can take care of their own laundry, clean after themselves and cook their own meals. Paying bills on time, making necessary medical appointments, and organizing schedules are some of the traits women want in men, too.</p>\n<p>No one has it all together, but having these basic life skills will show women that you are a good catch.</p>\n<h3>Being able to integrate into each other’s lives</h3>\n<p>You both have your own social circles, careers, and interests. When you enter a relationship or when you start seeing someone, you shouldn&#8217;t \xa0just fold into the other person’s life and abandon your own.</p>\n<p>Each of you should work to integrate into the other’s life and merge your lives together. This will require compromise on both sides. Perhaps you don’t want to attend the play she wants to see or you don&#8217;t really care for a particular set of friends that she has. Despite this, it&#8217;s still important that you do things with her that she enjoys and to be with people she likes. And she should do the same for you.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>What sets these traits apart is that they are deeper qualities that last. They have more value and they&#8217;ll put more importance on the quality of a relationship. Few of us can compete with Brad Pitt on looks, but we all can develop our sense of humor, improve our communication skills, and take care of ourselves. These are exactly what women look for in a man.</p>\n<p>If this list seems overwhelming, then just pick one and start improving yourself in that area.

There&#8217;s always a new gadget, appliance or a pair of shoes put on sale. If you are trying to cut down on your expenses and start saving, these things can easily put you off\xa0track.</p>\n<p>To help you out, here are a few tips on how to save more.</p>\n<h2>How To Save More And Spend Less</h2>\n<p>There are many simple ways to save more money without feeling the pain. You can even turn it into a challenge or a game to make it more enjoyable.</p>\n<h3>Save\xa0your loose change</h3>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34213 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/save-coins.jpg" alt="save coins" width="600" height="399" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/save-coins.jpg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/save-coins-400x266.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>Went shopping and now your purse is heavy with loose change? Count it, keep what you might need for bus tickets and other needs and put the rest in a special piggy bank. After two months, empty the piggy bank and deposit the amount in your savings account. This is one of simplest tips on how to save more.</p>\n<h3>Put it on auto pilot</h3>\n<p>Transferring cash online from your main account to a deposit account each month can be difficult, especially if you think you need all the money for your expenses.</p>\n<p>As a solution, you can open one or two recurring deposits and put your monthly deposit on auto debit. Because the transfer happens automatically,\xa0it will be easier for you to stick with your deposits.</p>\n<h3>Curb impulse buys</h3>\n<p>Received a promotional offer from your favorite shopping website with a big discount? Do not click on the link right away.</p>\n<p>When you put off a decision and you decide not to take immediate action, you get to avoid unnecessary expenses. So, instead of buying, transfer all or part of the amount you did not spend to another savings account.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also:\xa0<a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/fashion-hacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">Fashion Hacks That Can Save You Big Bucks</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Turn discounts and cash backs into cash savings</h3>\n<p>Whether online or offline, you may get discounts on specific items, coupons, and special offers that can help you save money. At the end of the month, deposit the total savings you managed to get from various discounts.</p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Give up your expensive habits</h3>\n<p>Cut down on the beer and cigarettes. Not only will this keep you healthier, but it’ll let you save up on unwanted expenses. Even the government is increasing the sin tax on these to reduce their usage. If you don’t stop now, you’ll end up paying a lot more for them anyway.</p>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>See Also:\xa0<a href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/tips-for-quitting-smoking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="internal">16 Essential Tips for Quitting Smoking</a></strong></p>\n<h3>Visit ATMs less often</h3>\n<p>Reducing the times you use the ATM can help you cut down on service charges. Instead of turning to those machines, manage your finances well so you won&#8217;t have to make unnecessary withdrawals.</p>\n<h3>Use cash</h3>\n<p>Every time you use your credit card, you’re losing track of exactly how much you’re spending. If you’re buying something, buy it with cash. This will give you a clearer idea of how much you’re actually spending. When you see more money leaving your hands, you’ll be warier of spending.</p>\n<h3>Carry your own bag when shopping</h3>\n<p>With the government taking measures to reduce plastic usage, most shops have moved onto jute and cloth bags. These bags, however, are more expensive when compared to plastic bags. Instead of paying for these, carry your own bag.</p>\n<h3>Walk, ride a bicycle, carpool</h3>\n<p><img class="size-full wp-image-34214 aligncenter" src="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ride-a-bicycle.jpeg" alt="ride a bicycle" width="600" height="337" srcset="https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ride-a-bicycle.jpeg 600w, https://www.dumblittleman.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ride-a-bicycle-400x225.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>If you’re going somewhere that’s a short distance away, put down the car keys. Walk or ride a bicycle. This not only saves you money on fuel charges, but it’s a great workout as well.</p>\n<p>Whenever you need to head to work, bring some colleagues along so you can share the fuel expenses. This way, not only are you collectively working to save the environment, but you’re also cutting down on fuel costs.</p>\n<h3>Set a goal</h3>\n<p>When it comes to saving money, it doesn&#8217;t always have to be about big goals. You can also save for small goals, like a new smartphone.</p>\n<p>Open a recurring deposit account and start saving for next year&#8217;s release of new smartphones. You can earn an interest with this type of account. Even if you get just 100 Rupees, it is still 100 rupees more than you had. You can use it to purchase your goal.</p>\n<p>These are just a few ideas. You can come up with more exciting ones, like challenging your siblings or friends on who can save more after a month.</p>\n<p>Saving doesn&#8217;t have to be boring. In fact, the more fun you&#8217;re having, \xa0the more likely you&#8217;re going to stick to it.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com/how-to-save-more/" data-wpel-link="internal">10 Easy Tricks On How To Save More</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dumblittleman.com" data-wpel-link="internal">Dumb Little Man</a>.</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/DumbLittleMan/~4/26SjDLyQmFw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>'}], 'img': {'links': [{'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html', 'href': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com'}], 'link': 'http://www.dumblittleman.com', 'href': 'http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y281/irw2003/dlmsmall.gif', 'title': 'Dumb Little Man', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/DumbLittleMan', 'value': 'Dumb Little Man'}}, 'enclosures': None}

Interesting Thing of the Day
{'title': 'Light Pollution / Urban assault on the night sky', 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/InterestingThingOfTheDay/~3/KYFGn83vYeI/r2', 'author': 'Joe Kissell', 'date': '2017.05.05', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/InterestingThingOfTheDay', 'value': '<p>I used to go for a walk every night. It was a pleasant habit&#8212;exercise, fresh air, quiet time alone to think. I made a point, whenever possible, of walking in an area away from the city lights, where the sky was dark enough that I could get a good look at the stars. I knew how to pick out some of the constellations, though I could never quite understand how anyone could see a goat or an archer in the patterns of stars. Seeing shapes in clouds is one thing, but mentally connecting the dots to form a complex picture didn&#8217;t really work for me. That&#8217;s not to say I didn&#8217;t see anything in the stars, though. As I looked at a particular star, I would think about the possibility of life in outer space, the chance that a planet circling that star may be home to people like me&#8212;or unfathomably different beings. I&#8217;d think about how Earth is just another one of those countless planets and the sun just another one of those countless stars. And picking my favorite star of the moment, I&#8217;d say to myself, &#8220;Someday I&#8217;ll find a way to go there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Looking at the stars and thinking about them in this way always had a very calming effect on me. I felt as though it gave me a sense of proportion, that it put my own crises and ambitions in perspective. It didn&#8217;t make me feel insignificantly small; instead, it made me feel somehow privileged to be able to see and understand what may be out there, and to realize I&#8217;m a part of something so big.</p>\n<p><strong>The Stars at Night Aren&#8217;t Big or Bright</strong><br />\nNowadays I don&#8217;t notice the stars very often, and when I do, I don&#8217;t usually think about them as I once did. But every now and then, I&#8217;ll be on a trip&#8212;an island, a desert, a rural getaway somewhere&#8212;and again the stars will catch my attention. Invariably I&#8217;ll wonder why I hadn&#8217;t noticed them in so long. Is it just that I&#8217;m older and busier? That may be part of it, but a bigger part is that the lights of the city often make it very hard to see the stars, always focusing my attention on the surface of my own planet. This is one consequence of the increasing problem of light pollution.</p>\n<p>The term &#8220;pollution&#8221; is apt because excess or unwanted light can be an irritation or even a safety hazard. Like air pollution, light pollution is typically a by-product of machines and devices that were intended to make our lives easier, more convenient, and safer. Another similarity is that light pollution can be reduced greatly with careful attention to design. But because most people have become accustomed to light pollution as a fact of life, there is usually little incentive to worry about it when designing or purchasing lighting products.</p>\n<p><strong>It Was a Bright and Stormy Night</strong><br />\nThe most frequently discussed manifestation of light pollution is a phenomenon called <em>skyglow</em>&#8212;a layer of glowing air that obscures anything beyond it. Skyglow occurs because the atmosphere itself diffuses the light; the effect is strongest when lights point upward, and it&#8217;s exacerbated by moisture, pollution, and dust. If you ever look up into a clear night sky in the city and find that very few stars are visible, skyglow is the culprit. The effect is even more striking from a distance; if you&#8217;re outside the city in a darker area, you can often see skyglow as a glowing haze over the brightly lit area, even if the lights themselves are not visible.</p>\n<p>There are other forms of light pollution as well. The term <em>light trespass</em> is used to describe light that shines onto someone else&#8217;s property. This can be a neighbor&#8217;s floodlight that shines into your backyard, for example, or a streetlight that shines into your window at night. Another type of light pollution is <em>glare</em>, a general term describing any kind of light that impairs or obscures one&#8217;s vision. Glare interferes with the eyes&#8217; natural ability to adapt to lower light levels at night, and can pose a serious safety hazard&#8212;especially for drivers.</p>\n<p><strong>I Wear my Sunglasses at Night</strong><br />\nAstronomers&#8212;both professional and amateur&#8212;have always found light pollution to be a serious problem. But stargazers are not the only ones affected. Biologists are increasingly concerned that light pollution is detrimental to wildlife&#8212;disrupting natural biological cycles, interfering with the hunting and feeding behaviors of nocturnal animals, and hindering the navigation of migrating birds. Humans may be directly affected as well: recent studies have suggested a connection between the use of electric lights at night and an increased risk of breast cancer. Even relatively small amounts of light reaching the eyes during sleep can throw off natural circadian rhythms, altering the body&#8217;s production of the sleep hormone melatonin and potentially leading to a variety of health problems.</p>\n<p>Light pollution is a solvable problem. The basic principle is to use light at night only where and when it&#8217;s actually needed, and only in the amount needed. This may involve shielding light fixtures so that light is directed downward (and away from adjacent properties), putting lights on timers or motion-activated switches, or using lower-wattage bulbs. There&#8217;s also the radical notion of <em>turning off outside lights at night</em>. According to conventional wisdom, more light equals more safety, so presumably brighter places should have less crime than darker ones. But surprisingly, this is not necessarily the case. Several school districts, in an effort to save money on electricity, tried turning off outside lights on schools and playgrounds at night and found, counterintuitively, that vandalism rates plummeted. That&#8217;s not to say you should start walking down dark alleys at night, but then, I suppose even criminals need to be able to see what they&#8217;re doing.</p>\n<p>Reducing light pollution is in some ways at odds with modern Western culture&#8212;especially when it comes to outdoor advertising and other commercial lighting. And no one is arguing that cities and towns would be safer or better places to live if the streets were completely dark. But even while we teach our children not to be afraid of the dark, we do our best to surround ourselves with light. Perhaps a bit more darkness wouldn&#8217;t be such a bad thing. It could turn out to be healthier and safer, not to mention providing some much-needed perspective. &#8212;<a href="http://joekissell.com/">Joe Kissell</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/250/light-pollution/">Permalink</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://itotd.com/send/250/">Email this Article</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Category:</strong> <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Society%20and%20Culture">Society &amp; Culture</a></p>\n\t\t\t<h3>More Information about Light Pollution...</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>To read about the increasing number of fields represented in the anti-light-pollution movement, see <a href="http://skyandtelescope.com/news/current/article_777_1.asp">Light Pollution Goes Mainstream</a> by Richard Tresch Fienberg in Sky &amp; Telescope.</p>\n<p>The Danish site <a href="http://www.amtsgym-sdbg.dk/as/sky.htm">Light pollution or not, that is the question</a> discusses the use of high-powered lighting devices (searchlights, lasers, etc.) for commercial advertising.</p>\n<p>Other good sources for information on light pollution and what you can do about it include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.darksky.org/">The International Dark-Sky Association</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://www.lightfromabove.org/">Light from Above</a>: a Light Pollution Awareness Community</li>\n<li><a href="http://members.aol.com/copernicanview/">Light Pollution Information</a> from the Astronomical Society of Greater Hartford</li>\n<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pollution">Light pollution</a> in the Wikipedia</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Information on how turning off lights at night has decreased vandalism in several school districts can be found in <a href="http://www.peninsula.wednet.edu/conservation/Energy/dark%20campus.HTM">this article</a> from Peninsula School District #401 in Gig Harbor, Washington.</p>\n<p>Want to see what light pollution looks like from a satellite?

Before I fell under his nefarious influence, I had very simple tastes. Food was food; a burger and fries eaten on the run was a perfectly satisfactory dining experience. But then I read <em>A Year in Provence</em> and its sequels, books that tell colorful tales about ordinary life in the southern French countryside. To hear Mayle describe life in Provence, every waking hour is concerned with acquiring, preparing, or eating food. His descriptions of wonderfully rich food and drink, enjoyed course after course in meals that stretch for hours, are sensual to the point of being called erotic. You can just taste the foie gras, the truffles, the escargots as you read. For impressionable minds like mine, there was only one possible outcome. I became a French food snob. And along my path to culinary enlightenment, I felt it necessary to sample&#8212;indeed, become somewhat expert on&#8212;a variety of French beverages. One drink that receives quite prominent treatment in Mayle&#8217;s books is pastis, which is as good a place to start as any.</p>\n<p>Pastis is a distilled spirit made from a blend of herbs. The flavor is predominantly that of anise, thus putting it in the same general class as sambuca and ouzo. It is commonly consumed as an aperitif&#8212;sort of a liquid, alcoholic appetizer&#8212;and in France, where it&#8217;s most popular, the custom is to dilute it at the table with about five parts of cold water. The ritual of adding the water, which causes the translucent yellowish liquid to turn cloudy, is part of the fun of drinking pastis. But the most interesting thing about pastis is its history. That it should exist at all is a bit of an accident.</p>\n<p><strong>The Fate of the Muse</strong><br />\nThroughout the 1800s, the aperitif of choice in France (and in many other places) was <a href="http://itotd.com/articles/243/absinthe/">absinthe</a>. This potent drink was also distilled from herbs and had a strong anise flavor. Many artists and writers swore that absinthe enhanced their creativity, calling it &#8220;the green muse.&#8221; This unusual effect of absinthe was thought to come from its key ingredient, an herb called wormwood. However, absinthe was also thought to cause hallucinations, violence, blindness, and even insanity. Although no solid scientific proof of wormwood&#8217;s toxicity was produced, absinthe became an easy scapegoat for a large number of social ills. By the early 20th century, public opinion had turned against absinthe and it was banned in France and most other western countries.</p>\n<p>While this satisfied the prohibitionist urges of a vocal minority, there were two groups of people who were quite displeased with the ban: the millions of absinthe drinkers who suffered no apparent harm, and the distillers, such as Jules Pernod, whose plant produced thousands of bottles a day. Necessity, it is said, is the mother of invention. The combination of public demand for a legal but absinthe-like drink and the distilleries&#8217; desire to stay in business inevitably led to a substitute: pastis. It is made in the same manner&#8212;and from many of the same ingredients&#8212;as absinthe. However, the alcohol level is much lower and it does not include wormwood. Under such brand names as Pernod and Ricard, pastis rapidly rose to popularity in France, and within a few decades, absinthe was all but forgotten.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Secret Recipe: Eleven Herbs and Spices</strong><br />\nToday, there are hundreds of brands of pastis, each with a unique formula. Among the most common ingredients are licorice, star anise, cardamom, fennel, and coriander&#8212;though some formulas contain dozens of different herbs. Colors range from clear to gold to green, and as with wines (or even colas), the subtleties in flavor provoke fierce loyalties. Having sampled perhaps a dozen varieties myself, I would venture to say that the similarities are greater than the differences, but tasting pastis is a sort of self-defeating exercise. After a few glasses it becomes difficult to distinguish one flavor from another&#8212;or, for that matter, up from down. Curiously, even though I don&#8217;t care for the flavor of licorice in food or candy, I find essentially the same flavor unobjectionable in pastis.</p>\n<p>I have several brands of pastis in my bar at home, but I much prefer the experience of enjoying it at a restaurant, before a good French meal. Although in France pastis is the most common spirit by far, it has not achieved a great deal of popularity in the United States. Almost every well-stocked bar and restaurant has at least one brand of pastis, but customers seldom order it. A while back, Morgen and I had dinner at Masa&#8217;s, an upscale San Francisco restaurant whose head chef, Ron Siegel, was the first American to beat an Iron Chef. We arrived a bit early and decided to order pastis at the bar while waiting for our table. The bartender knew what we meant and also confirmed that we wanted it served in the traditional French manner&#8212;not on the rocks, as is more typically American. He said it had been a long time since anyone had ordered pastis, and he seemed a bit surprised that we would know about it. I, on the other hand, knew we were in good hands at the restaurant if the kitchen staff knew their stuff as well as the bartender knew his (and they did).</p>\n<p><strong>We Call it &#8220;Pop&#8221; in this Part of the Country</strong><br />\nUnfortunately, this restaurant is the exception rather than the rule. In my experience, a majority of bartenders and waiters in the United States have little or no familiarity with pastis, even in fancy French restaurants&#8230;even in very old and famously absinthe-centric locales&#8230;and even if they stock it in their bar. On our honeymoon in New Orleans, Morgen and I visited Antoine&#8217;s, the oldest French restaurant in New Orleans&#8212;in fact, the oldest restaurant under single-family ownership in the entire United States. Antoine&#8217;s is legendary for its excellent menu and outstanding service, and having already visited a couple of Emeril Lagasse&#8217;s restaurants, we were ready to be impressed. The menus were in French&#8212;always a good sign. As we sat down, our waiter asked if we&#8217;d like aperitifs, and I said, &#8220;Yes, please, two pastis with water.&#8221; The waiter gave me a strange look, so I repeated: &#8220;Pastis.&#8221; Still apparently confused, he nodded and disappeared into the kitchen.</p>\n<p>A few minutes later he returned, somewhat befuddled, with two glasses of <em>cassis</em> (a fruity liqueur made from black currants) and a carafe of water. His puzzlement was apparently due to the fact that it is quite strange to order cassis with water.

Carver is best known for devising over 300 uses for peanuts&#8212;from ink to glue to soap, not to mention a great many recipes for peanut-based foods. Although I&#8217;ve often wondered why I don&#8217;t see peanut paint or peanut insecticide at my local hardware store, I have the utmost respect for Carver&#8217;s discoveries and for the versatility of this humble legume.</p>\n<p>Peanuts have got to be one of my top ten favorite foods. I love peanuts in or on chocolate, ice cream, Pad Thai, satays, soups, sauces, and just about everywhere else. They&#8217;re especially good on airplanes (which otherwise tend to have a rather metallic taste). So when I heard about a peanut-based beverage that also reputedly had fantastic health benefits, I couldn&#8217;t wait to try it. The product in question is the suspiciously named Signs and Wonders brand peanut milk, developed right here in San Francisco. Although you can buy it from a number of small stores, the best place to get it is the KK Cafe near the corner of Haight and Divisadero Streets, where it was invented.</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s the Great Peanut, Charlie Brown</strong><br />\nThe story goes like this. Jack Chang, who along with his wife Margaret owns a tiny burger joint/coffee shop called the KK Cafe, loved peanuts. But due to chronic gum disease he was unable to chew them, so he set about making a drink that would enable him to enjoy his peanuts in convenient liquid form. It took him months to get the recipe just right, but being a frugal person he felt obliged to drink all the failed batches. As he consumed increasing amounts of this concoction, he noticed that he felt more energetic, his allergies cleared up, and his gums returned to health. He even stopped losing his hair. There could be no other explanation than his peanut drink&#8212;well, that and God, but I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself&#8212;so the couple began recommending the stuff to all of their customers suffering from various kinds of ailments. Sure enough, this person&#8217;s arthritis went away, that person&#8217;s skin rash healed, and soon testimonials were pouring in and word began to spread that the Changs had invented a cure-all in the form of a tasty peanut drink.</p>\n<p>What Chang calls &#8220;peanut milk&#8221; is a nondairy product made primarily from ground peanuts and water, with some sugar, other grains, and a few herbs and spices. Interestingly, it tastes almost exactly like a mixture of ground peanuts, water, and sugar&#8212;which is to say, in my humble opinion, kind of gross. It was all I could do to get through a single 8-oz. (240ml) bottle&#8212;and remember, I&#8217;m speaking as a peanut lover here. Other people clearly differ in their opinion of the flavor, consuming, in some cases, several quarts per day. Or perhaps they&#8217;re too enthusiastic about its supposed health benefits to concern themselves with taste. In all fairness, it does certainly taste much better than, for example, a mixture of cough syrup, castor oil, and spirulina, to pick three ingredients completely at random.</p>\n<p><strong>Suspending Disbelief</strong><br />\nThe Changs are careful not to make specific health claims for their product in its labeling or advertising; all the same, they do point to the huge number of letters they&#8217;ve received as anecdotal evidence of peanut milk&#8217;s ability to confer on the drinker an astonishing range of health benefits. To be sure, the individual ingredients are nutritious. Peanut milk contains vitamins, minerals, and protein, and is relatively low in calories, so it&#8217;s reasonable to believe that it could provide energy and support one&#8217;s immune system, in addition to being a healthier drink than soda (or, for that matter, most other beverages). But the stories of its ability to cure everything from asthma to cancer are as hard for me to swallow as a suspension of ground peanuts.</p>\n<p>For Jack and Margaret Chang, the explanation of peanut milk&#8217;s seemingly magical powers is simple: their formula is a God-given miracle&#8212;hence the name &#8220;Signs and Wonders.&#8221; Personally, I&#8217;d feel a bit uncomfortable attributing a recipe to God, especially a recipe whose taste strikes me as, shall we say, less than heavenly&#8212;and which, we are adequately warned, could be deadly to those with certain allergies. I wouldn&#8217;t go so far as to chalk up all the alleged benefits of peanut milk to the placebo effect, but I would expect that if it really does have curative properties, similar benefits could be achieved by consuming the ingredients in more conventional forms.</p>\n<p><strong>Milking Publicity</strong><br />\nEven though peanut milk didn&#8217;t impress me, increasing numbers of customers swear by it. With barely any advertising other than word-of-mouth and a few news stories, peanut milk has grown in popularity beyond the point where Jack and Margaret can produce enough on their own to meet the demand. So they&#8217;ve outsourced production to a factory across the bay in Hayward, California. A few years ago you could purchase peanut milk only at the KK Cafe, but it&#8217;s now available in dozens of stores in the San Francisco Bay area, with a deal for national distribution reportedly in the works.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly enough, not one of George Washington Carver&#8217;s peanut products was &#8220;magic peanut elixir.&#8221; But then, Carver did achieve considerable success, fame, and influence, and peanuts helped to propel at least one person to the presidency of the United States. You know, now that I think of it, maybe with a bit of chocolate that peanut milk wouldn&#8217;t be so bad after all. &#8212;<a href="http://joekissell.com/">Joe Kissell</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/247/peanut-milk/">Permalink</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://itotd.com/send/247/">Email this Article</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Categories:</strong> <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Food%20and%20Drink">Food &amp; Drink</a>, <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Mind%20and%20Body">Mind &amp; Body</a></p>\n\t\t\t<h3>More Information about Peanut Milk...</h3>\n\t\t\t<p><br />\nTo learn more about Signs and Wonders peanut milk and its producers, visit their <a href="http://www.peanutmilk.net/">Web site</a>.

{'title': 'The Dvorak Keyboard Controversy / Chasing QWERTY', 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/InterestingThingOfTheDay/~3/JUqLT3RFnpo/r2', 'author': 'Joe Kissell', 'date': '2017.04.28', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/InterestingThingOfTheDay', 'value': '<p>When I was first learning to type, many years ago, I asked the same question everyone else asks: why are the keys arranged so stupidly? Why aren&#8217;t they laid out in a more logical order, as in, just to take one random example, alphabetically? The answer I&#8217;ve heard countless times is that the first typewriter keyboards were arranged alphabetically, but that caused mechanical problems&#8212;once typists became reasonably proficient, the keys jammed frequently because the hammers corresponding to certain frequently used letter sequences were too close together. As a result, so the story goes, the QWERTY layout was designed to prevent jamming by moving those letters farther apart, thus slowing down the typists to a speed the machine could handle. Meanwhile, a more sensible and efficient layout called the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard has been around for a long time, but never became very popular because QWERTY simply had too much momentum in the marketplace.</p>\n<p>That story has frequently been used (even by me) as an example of how an inferior, inefficient design came to be the standard&#8212;and remained so, long after the original reasons for its success became irrelevant. But the truth is more complicated and surprisingly controversial.</p>\n<p><strong>Faster than a Speeding Typist</strong><br />\nThe first issue is whether the switch to the QWERTY layout was truly intended to slow down typists&#8212;whether it was a matter of deliberately inconveniencing people for the sake of machines or whether it was simply expedient engineering. I have never seen any statistics as to how fast anyone could type using the original, alphabetical keyboard layout, but I think it&#8217;s fair to imagine that it would be faster <em>only</em> for people who have to look at the keys while they type. For well-trained touch-typists, I very much doubt that an alphabetical layout would yield any speed increase over QWERTY, and there is some evidence to suggest exactly the opposite. QWERTY may have its faults, but it seems to me that one need not get upset (as many have) that we&#8217;re all using a layout that&#8217;s substantially worse than the original.</p>\n<p>But is there some layout that&#8217;s demonstrably much better than QWERTY? A lot of people think the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard meets that description. Dr. August Dvorak, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, designed this alternative layout in 1932 and patented it in 1936. Dvorak&#8217;s goal was to reduce typing fatigue by minimizing finger movement, so he put the most commonly used letters (including all the vowels) on the &#8220;home&#8221; row, while placing letters like Q and Z and certain punctuation characters in spots that are harder to reach. The Dvorak layout also favors the right hand, on the grounds that the majority of people are right-handed. Dvorak naturally claimed that his design was much better than QWERTY, but we need not take his word for it. A study performed by the U.S. Navy in 1944 showed speed improvements of as much as 75% when people who had previously learned the QWERTY layout were retrained on Dvorak keyboards. And that, say Dvorak supporters, should be that.</p>\n<p><strong>Dark Days for Dvorak</strong><br />\nHowever, another study&#8212;this one performed in 1956 by the U.S. General Service Administration (GSA)&#8212;failed to confirm the results of the Navy test. It found, in a nutshell, that QWERTY was at least as efficient as Dvorak, and possibly more so. Further research conducted from the 1950s through the 1970s showed little or no advantage for Dvorak.</p>\n<p>Two economists, Stan Liebowitz and Stephen E. Margolis, have written extensively about the Dvorak-versus-QWERTY debate. They mention the research suggesting QWERTY&#8217;s superiority and point out a number of significant flaws in the 1944 Navy study, not the least of which is the fact that Dvorak himself apparently oversaw that research in some capacity. In short, they say, the Dvorak layout isn&#8217;t and never was any better than QWERTY, and the only thing the pro-Dvorak studies really prove is that anyone who is retrained on any keyboard layout will get better. Therefore, no one should use QWERTY as an example of the free market &#8220;choosing&#8221; an inferior technology.</p>\n<p><strong>Rejoinder to the Rebuttal</strong><br />\nBut wait! Dvorak&#8217;s not out yet. Supporters of Dvorak claim that Liebowitz and Margolis have an axe to grind, and that in the very process of showing how earlier research was fudged, they fudged facts themselves. Specifically, pro-Dvorak folks say, the economists failed to mention that Earle Strong, who was in charge of the 1956 GSA study, had a personal grudge against Dvorak and had made public statements before that study was even performed voicing his opposition to any alternative keyboard layout. Randy C. Cassingham, author of the 1986 book <em>Dvorak Keyboard: The Ergonomically Designed Keyboard, Now an American Standard</em> (an unbiased title if ever I heard one), attempted to debunk Liebowitz and Margolis&#8217;s findings soon after they were originally published, but his work has been little noticed&#8212;except by other die-hard Dvorak fans looking to bolster their position.</p>\n<p>The ferocity with which both pro- and anti-Dvorak views are evangelized in some circles rivals that of a religious or political cause. Both sides selectively downplay or emphasize whichever facts suit them best, and there&#8217;s precious little research on the subject that&#8217;s both truly objective and modern enough to have been performed using computers rather than typewriters. Anecdotally, Dvorak users frequently cite greater comfort as one reason for preferring it, and some claim that because Dvorak involves less finger movement, it&#8217;s less likely to contribute to repetitive stress injuries. Opponents counter that if you truly can type faster with Dvorak, then the increased <em>number</em> of movements will offset the ergonomic gains made by the decreased range of motion. And the debate goes on and on</p>\n<p><strong>The Best Test</strong><br />\nAll modern computers&#8212;Macs, PCs, and Linux machines&#8212;include the capability of switching into a Dvorak layout if that&#8217;s what you prefer (though the physical keys won&#8217;t match the characters they type unless you perform some minor surgery on your keyboard or put stickers over the existing letters). So if you want to try out Dvorak yourself, you need only consult your computer&#8217;s Help to find out how to change that setting. Chances are you&#8217;ll find that it takes a few weeks or so to retrain yourself to the point where you&#8217;re about as fast as you were using QWERTY. If you can tolerate the temporary loss in productivity, you may find the experiment useful.</p>\n<p>I tried learning Dvorak myself, years ago, but gave up before I became proficient&#8212;I had to get my work done. On the other hand, I can already type as fast as I should ever need to using QWERTY. For me, the bottleneck is usually how fast I can think, not how fast I can type, so I suspect Dvorak would not make my life meaningfully better. If I spent all day, every day, doing straight transcription or had a quota to meet, though, I might relish any chance for a potential speed increase. Better yet, I might start looking for a job that didn&#8217;t involve typing at all. &#8212;<a href="http://joekissell.com/">Joe Kissell</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/651/the-dvorak-keyboard-controversy/">Permalink</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://itotd.com/send/651/">Email this Article</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Category:</strong> <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Technology%20and%20Computing">Technology &amp; Computing</a></p>\n\t\t\t<h3>More Information about The Dvorak Keyboard Controversy...</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>Anti-Dvorak articles by Liebowitz and Margolis include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/keys1.html">The Fable of the Keys</a> in the <em>Journal of Law &amp; Economics</em> vol.

Today we add to that list a palace constructed in its entirety by an eccentric of modest means: a postman named Ferdinand Cheval.</p>\n<p>The story begins in 1879. Cheval, then 43 years old, had been working as a rural mail carrier in the southeast of France for 12 years. Because his daily routine involved walking about 20 miles (32km), mostly in solitude, he did a lot of daydreaming. One day (perhaps while his mind was elsewhere), he tripped over a small limestone rock. He noticed that the rock was oddly and beautifully shaped, so he wrapped it up in his handkerchief, put it in his pocket, and took it home with him. The next day, he went back to the same spot and found lots of other interesting stones. He recalled a striking dream he&#8217;d had in 1864, in which he&#8217;d built a huge castle of stone. Right then and there, he decided to make his dream a reality: he made it his life&#8217;s mission to collect enough stones to construct that castle.</p>\n<p><strong>Going Postal</strong><br />\nCheval began collecting rocks on his rounds, eventually adding about 5 miles (8km) of walking per day. At first he kept the stones in his pockets, then moved on to baskets and, finally, a wheelbarrow as the size and quantity of the stones he collected increased. Back at home, he set to work arranging the stones into an ever-larger structure. He also made numerous figures of people, animals, and plants out of concrete and blended these into the creation, which was held together with the help of cement and wire. Despite ridicule from his neighbors, he continued working on the project for 33 years, and it became his full-time occupation after he retired from the post office in 1896. By the time he declared it finished, in 1912, it had grown to roughly 85 feet (26m) long, 40 feet (12m) wide, and 35 feet (11m) high. It was dubbed Le Palais Id&#00233;al du Facteur Cheval (or Postman Cheval&#8217;s Ideal Palace).</p>\n<p>And it looks like&#8230;well, no one can really say what it looks like. Cheval&#8217;s vision had been that of a fantastical structure incorporating elements from many different architectural styles. Part of it was intended to emulate a Hindu temple; part of it is supposed to look like a medieval castle. There are also influences from numerous other cultures from all over the world. And yet, the final product&#8212;a pastiche though it may be&#8212;has an odd sort of coherence that evokes (or possibly even inspired) Dr. Seuss.</p>\n<p><strong>Dying for Recognition</strong><br />\nBy the time the palace was complete, it had begun to draw international attention. Famous artists visited and drew inspiration from it; it was featured in media from postcards to magazines; and people came from far and wide to see this astonishing building. Public opinion about the work and its creator eventually shifted, and Cheval himself came to be regarded as an artist of some renown.</p>\n<p>However, even though Cheval had essentially put the town of Hauterives on the map, the city government denied his request to be buried, along with his wife, in the palace. Not to be deterred, he went back to work in 1914 on a second, smaller structure in the local cemetery. He spent eight years building what he called the Tomb of Silence and Eternal Rest. Two years after its completion&#8212;and just days after he finished writing his autobiography&#8212;Cheval died and was interred in this new structure.</p>\n<p><strong>Set in Stone</strong><br />\nThe Palais Id&#00233;al was declared a cultural landmark in 1969, and underwent extensive renovations from 1983 to 1993. Today, the site draws more than 100,000 visitors per year to Hauterives. An exhibition at Paris&#8217;s Mus&#00233;e de la Poste (Post Office Museum) in 2007 showcased artwork inspired by Cheval&#8217;s palace, and included numerous artifacts relating to its history&#8212;including the original visitors&#8217; log begun in 1905. The centerpiece of the exhibit was a detailed one-tenth-scale model of the palace (shown in the photo above).</p>\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t call this structure a work of architectural genius, and its artistic merits (or lack thereof) have been much debated. But no one can dispute that it&#8217;s audacious, wacky, and impressive. Whatever drove Cheval to spend half his life collecting stones and building bizarre monuments, it earned him a place in history as one of only a few truly famous postmen. &#8212;<a href="http://joekissell.com/">Joe Kissell</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/650/palais-ideal/">Permalink</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://itotd.com/send/650/">Email this Article</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Category:</strong> <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Interesting%20Places">Interesting Places</a></p>\n\t\t\t<h3>More Information about Palais Idéal...</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>The palace&#8217;s <a href="http://www.facteurcheval.com/">official Web site</a> has photos, videos, history, and tourist information; you can find abbreviated details at <a href="http://www.whatsonwhen.com/sisp/index.htm?fx=event&amp;event_id=91127">Whatsonwhen</a>.</p>\n<p>You can find some nice <a href="http://www.claudetravels.altervista.org/VdR/PalaisIdeal/gal.html">photos of the palace</a> at Claude Travels.</p>\n<p>Two lengthier articles about the palace and the man who built it are <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/05/03/arts/blume.php?page=1">The postman who delivered a palace</a> by Mary Blume at the International Herald Tribune (May 3, 2007) and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/offthemap/html/travelogue_artist_4.htm?true">Palais Id&#00233;al</a> at Off the Map.

{'title': 'Planning Your Own Funeral / Having the last laugh first', 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/InterestingThingOfTheDay/~3/dP9Fh4WJ6tc/r2', 'author': 'Joe Kissell', 'date': '2017.04.24', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/InterestingThingOfTheDay', 'value': '<p>When my mother returned from a vacation to Florida with her sister a number of months ago, I called to ask how it went. &#8220;Oh, we had the best time!&#8221; she said. &#8220;We spent most of the trip planning our funerals. It was hilarious!&#8221; Well, that wasn&#8217;t quite what I was expecting to hear. On previous vacations my mom has gone on cruises, even tried parasailing, and I thought I had a pretty good idea of what activities she considered fun. Funeral planning was a bit of a surprise. It&#8217;s not that she&#8217;s ill or expecting to die soon. But, as she put it, &#8220;If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve seen some of those late-night commercials trying to sell funeral insurance, with the idea being that you can save your grieving loved ones the considerable expense associated with funerals and burial. But that wasn&#8217;t what my mother had in mind at all. (In fact, she made a point of saying that since she&#8217;d relieved the family of the burden of funeral planning, the least we could do is pay for it!) Rather, she&#8217;d gone to some local funeral parlors and asked them for pre-planning forms she could fill out, detailing her background and family contact information, and specifying her wishes for things like burial versus cremation, type of casket, a minister to preside over the ceremony, and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Survivor: The Afterlife</strong><br />\nWhat made this all so funny? For starters, these forms&#8212;which, mind you, are intended to be filled out by the person on whose behalf the services will be performed&#8212;often begin by asking you to list your survivors. That whole idea gave Mom and Aunt Ruth the giggles&#8212;how would they know, now, who will survive them? But even though you may have to leave a few sections blank, planning your own funeral gives you the chance to approach the details of how your death will be observed with a rare mixture of detachment and subjectivity. In other words, while you&#8217;re alive and healthy, you can have fun with the activity in a way that your bereaved loved ones, under the stress of the moment, never could.</p>\n<p>Most pre-planning forms ask for basic things like whether you&#8217;d prefer a religious, secular, or military funeral. But you can get as detailed as you&#8217;d like. List the music you want to have played or sung. What kinds of flowers you want, if any. Scripture passages, poems, or other readings you&#8217;d like to have presented. Names of potential pallbearers. And even details about what clothes or jewelry you&#8217;ll be wearing while lying in that casket, whether you&#8217;ll have your glasses on, and what items should be added or removed before the casket goes in the ground. (My dad has always joked that he&#8217;d like to be buried with a plate of spare ribs. It could happen.)</p>\n<p><strong>Lay-Away Plan</strong><br />\nAlthough it has always been possible to state your own funeral preferences, either in a will or elsewhere, the trend of doing more involved funeral planning for oneself seems to be picking up steam. The topic is covered in various books and Web sites, and of course most funeral directors can supply you with brochures, forms, and other information about their particular services. But for some people, merely planning out a memorial service is not enough. Among the other things you can now arrange are the following:</p>\n<p><strong>Have your ashes scattered at sea.</strong> The <a href="http://www.neptunesociety.com/">Neptune Society</a> specializes in planning for cremation, and offers optional ceremonies at sea.</p>\n<p><strong>Rebuild Atlantis.</strong> I am absolutely not making this up. You can have your ashes encased in concrete and used as one of the building blocks of an artificial reef being constructed off the coast of Miami. The <a href="http://www.atlantismemorialreef.com/home.htm">Atlantis Memorial Reef</a> is being designed as an underwater garden that looks like some artist&#8217;s idea of Atlantis, and you can spend eternity there if you want.</p>\n<p><strong>Go into space.</strong> It&#8217;s not just for celebrity zillionaires and starship engineers. You, too, can have a small portion of your ashes sent into space by <a href="http://www.memorialspaceflights.com/">Memorial Spaceflights</a>. Prices start at just $500 for a brief trip into zero gravity and back; $1,300 for an indefinite stay in orbit; or $12,500 to have your ashes sent to the moon&#8212;or even into deep space on a spacecraft powered by a <a href="http://itotd.com/articles/573/solar-sails/">solar sail</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Cut glass.</strong> If you&#8217;d like to keep your eternal remains close to home, you can have your ashes compressed into an artificial diamond by a company called <a href="http://www.lifegem.com/">LifeGem</a>. That&#8217;s right: you can wear Grandma around your neck. Prices start at $3,300 and go up to $25,000. Only slightly less creepy: the same company can make gems from a lock of someone&#8217;s hair&#8212;dead or alive.</p>\n<p><strong>Furnish your home for the afterlife.</strong> If you think cremation offers more attractive options than burial, you haven&#8217;t visited <a href="http://www.casketfurniture.com/casket_furniture.php">CasketFurniture.com</a>, which makes sofas, coffee tables, beds, entertainment centers, and other pieces of furniture that not only look like coffins&#8212;they can be converted, upon your death, to hold your remains. If you spend all your time lying on the couch anyway, why not buy one you can enjoy for centuries to come?</p>\n<p>One step my mother has not yet taken&#8212;but plans to&#8212;is writing her own obituary. She wants to make sure it hits all the most interesting and important highlights. Unfortunately, you can&#8217;t control everything that will happen after your death. Maybe it&#8217;ll rain the day you&#8217;re buried; maybe the cat will knock over your urn of ashes; maybe your eulogy will have irritating grammatical errors. These things happen. You may not get the very last laugh, but you can at least make the Reaper a bit less grim. &#8212;<a href="http://joekissell.com/">Joe Kissell</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/649/planning-your-own-funeral/">Permalink</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://itotd.com/send/649/">Email this Article</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Categories:</strong> <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Decay">Decay</a>, <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Society%20and%20Culture">Society &amp; Culture</a></p>\n\t\t\t<h3>More Information about Planning Your Own Funeral...</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>Thanks to reader Toni Coleman for suggesting today&#8217;s topic! </p>\n<p><em><a href="http://www.memorialpreferences.com/">Memorial Preferences</a></em> is a $12.95 ebook about funeral planning.

In 1976, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned the dye FD&amp;C Red #2 because scientific studies showed it had carcinogenic effects on female rats. In response to the public concern about red food coloring, food manufacturers discontinued some of their red products, even if they didn&#8217;t contain Red #2. I remember this clearly because it meant that certain types of candy (such as M&amp;Ms) no longer included red-colored pieces, and that I avoided any red candies I came across. More recently, another type of red food dye, FD&amp;C #40, has been linked to increased hyperactivity in children, although it remains on the list of FDA-approved color additives. </p>\n<p>Because of the controversy surrounding these artificial dyes, some food manufacturers have turned to another source of red coloring. Known as cochineal, or in some forms, carmine, this dye, produced from a type of insect native to South America and Mexico called the cochineal, has a history that goes back hundreds of years. </p>\n<p><strong>A Prickly Subject</strong><br />\nThe cochineal insect&#8217;s entire life cycle takes place on the pads of certain species of prickly pear cacti. Although sometimes mistakenly referred to as a beetle, it is in fact a scale insect, a type of bug that is usually quite small and that lives by attaching itself to a host plant and drawing sustenance from it. Like other scale insects, the cochineal produces a protective covering for itself, which appears as a white fluffy material on the pads of the cactus. The females are larger than the males, and live longer than the one week that is typical for males. Cochineal insects produce a chemical called carminic acid, which helps them repel predators, and is the source of the dark purple color used to make cochineal dye. </p>\n<p>The traditional method of obtaining the dye is to remove the insects from the cactus pads by hand, and then to dry them in the sun before crushing them into a powder. It&#8217;s estimated that it takes about 70,000 cochineal insects to produce one pound (about 500 grams) of the cochineal powder. Carmine is a further refinement of the cochineal dye, obtained through a process of boiling the powder with certain other chemical compounds. </p>\n<p><strong>The Cochineal Craze</strong><br />\nThe production of cochineal was well established in Mexico when the Spanish first arrived there in the 16th century. Impressed with the vividness of the dye, they soon began exporting cochineal to Spain and the rest of Europe in vast quantities. Cochineal became a prized commodity on the Continent (Spain refused to trade it with the English), and it created huge profits for Spain. For this reason, the cultivation of cochineal was aggressively restricted to Spanish-controlled Mexico, although this changed when a French naturalist managed to smuggle cochineal-infested cactus pads to Haiti in 1777.</p>\n<p>From there, cochineal production eventually expanded to South America, India, Portugal, and the Canary Islands, where it became particularly successful. The long-time demand for cochineal started to ebb in the late 1800s as new synthetic dyes were developed, and soon it was no longer economically viable to continue its production. </p>\n<p><strong>Seeing Red</strong><br />\nNow, however, cochineal has emerged as a non-toxic alternative to the artificial dyes that supplanted it in the 1800s, and it is again cultivated in the Canary Islands, Peru, and Mexico. Not limited to food, cochineal and carmine are used to give alcoholic beverages, cosmetics, shampoo, and pharmaceuticals a bright red color, and are now regularly added to such food items as meat, poultry, jam, cheese, pastries, yogurt, and fruit juices. </p>\n<p>Until recently, manufacturers in the U.S. were not required to list cochineal and carmine as specific ingredients in their products, but in response to public protest, the FDA began to look into the issue in January 2006. Certain groups of people, among them vegans, those who observe kosher or halal dietary restrictions, and people who have found they are allergic to cochineal, argue that they should be warned about food items containing crushed insects. I agree with them; although I have no concrete objection to consuming insect carcasses with my daily yogurt, I would appreciate having full knowledge about what I&#08217;m eating all the same. &#8212;<a href="http://spectatrix.com/">Morgen Jahnke</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/648/cochineal/">Permalink</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://itotd.com/send/648/">Email this Article</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Categories:</strong> <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Food%20and%20Drink">Food &amp; Drink</a>, <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Science%20and%20Nature">Science &amp; Nature</a>, <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Technology%20and%20Computing">Technology &amp; Computing</a></p>\n\t\t\t<h3>More Information about Cochineal...</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>Thanks to Lisa Vawter for setting us straight on the whole &#8220;cochineal are not beetles&#8221; thing.</p>\n<p>The history of the food coloring &#8220;red scare&#8221; in the 1970s is detailed in John Henkel&#8217;s essay, <a href="http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/col-221.html">From Shampoo to Cereal: Seeing to the Safety of Color Additives</a>, on the FDA&#8217;s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Web site.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/economicbotany/Cochineal/index.html">Red Scales in the Sunset</a> by Professor Arthur Gibson of UCLA is a good overview of cochineal beetles and the production of cochineal. </p>\n<p>To see photos of cochineal-infested cacti, visit the <a href="http://www.texasindians.com/coch1.htm">Texas Indians</a> Web site. </p>\n<p>In January 2006, the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB113833159673257881-7aQTK755ykjASE3hGnfjQrjZlSk_20060203.html">Wall Street Journal</a> reported on the new FDA proposal regarding cochineal and carmine product labeling. </p>\n<p>The text of the FDA&#8217;s January 2006 report can be found on the <a href="http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fr060130.html">Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition Web site</a>.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<h3>Related Articles from Interesting Thing of the Day</h3>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/383/the-color-purple/">The Color Purple</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/446/leaf-cutter-ants/">Leaf Cutter Ants</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/451/non-human-farmers/">Non-Human Farmers</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/621/entomophagy/">Entomophagy</a></li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t<p class="copyright">&#x2117; &amp; &#xA9; 2007, <a href="http://alt.cc/">alt concepts</a>.

My initial reaction was, &#8220;Ah, another cheesy American fad is reborn,&#8221; followed quickly by, &#8220;Cool! I need to own this stuff.&#8221; What can I say? I&#8217;m a sucker for faux culture, especially <em>exotic</em> faux culture&#8212;particularly when it involves interesting drinks. But I soon realized that I had only ever heard the word &#8220;Tiki&#8221; used as an adjective. I didn&#8217;t know what a Tiki actually was. I could identify Tiki-themed merchandise easily enough, but I wasn&#8217;t quite clear what culture it was supposed to represent. So I decided to do some research.</p>\n<p>My first step, of course, was to watch the film &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean.&#8221; Other than being set in the wrong ocean, it was a good way to get those Tiki juices flowing. After all, it does involve islands and rum. But it made me hearken back to the attraction of the same name that I&#8217;ve visited at both Walt Disney World and Disneyland. This, in turn, reminded me of yet another notorious Disney attraction which is also populated by those ubiquitous Audio-Animatronic characters&#8212;namely, the Enchanted Tiki Room. Ah, now we&#8217;re getting somewhere. So my next stop was the closest approximation of the Enchanted Tiki Room I could find in San Francisco: a restaurant called the Tonga Room. And what luck: just in time for happy hour and an all-you-can-eat buffet. At last I was getting somewhere.</p>\n<p><strong>The Authentic Fake-Polynesian Experience</strong><br />\nThe Tonga Room, like any good Tiki bar, is dark and funky, with a nautical feel, fake palm trees, and lots of large carved wooden statues. Unlike most Tiki bars, however, this one has a pool in the middle, with a floating raft that functions as a stage for the band. And every 20 minutes or so, visitors are treated to an authentic artificial Pacific thundershower. Morgen and I sat down, ordered scary-sounding tropical drinks, and loaded up our plates with vaguely Pacific-looking treats&#8212;basically a dim sum selection and a number of dishes involving pineapple. There could be no doubt that we were at last having a genuine Tiki experience. But the question still nagged at me&#8230;what does Tiki actually <em>mean</em>?</p>\n<p>As I learned after some research on the Web, a Tiki is a carved statue representing a Polynesian god. OK, fair enough. But it turns out that &#8220;Polynesian&#8221; is a fairly broad and ambiguous term, as Polynesia covers a vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean&#8212;from Easter Island to Hawaii to New Zealand&#8212;and the cultures and languages represented are numerous and heterogenous. In some part of Polynesia, apparently, islanders once made and worshipped statues referred to as Tikis. So what does that have to do with a wacky American fad?</p>\n<p>In the 1930s, bars and restaurants in southern California began to adopt South Pacific themes, as Americans were just starting to discover Polynesian foods and cultures. In an effort to lend some authenticity to the bars, artifacts from various Pacific islands began to show up, and Tiki statues soon became regular fixtures. Put a Tiki in a bar and, ipso facto, you&#8217;ve got a Tiki bar. And what would a theme bar be without special drinks? So bar owners invented strong, fruity drinks with exotic names like &#8220;Mai Tai&#8221;&#8212;often served in Tiki-shaped glasses&#8212;even though the drinks themselves had nothing to do with Polynesia. Neither, for the most part, did the food or music that became part of Tiki culture; like the d&#00233;cor, they were composed of bits and pieces from lots of different places, along with a healthy dose of imagination. Ironically, the very effort to make Pacific-themed bars more &#8220;authentic&#8221; eventually led to the creation of a pseudoculture that didn&#8217;t resemble anything in the real world. But that didn&#8217;t stop it from taking on a life of its own.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros and Kon-Tiki</strong><br />\nTiki culture soon got another boost. According to Polynesian folklore, the earliest inhabitants of the Polynesian islands had come from South America, led by a mythical figure named Kon-Tiki. But it was popularly believed that such a long voyage would have been impossible using the technology available when the first settlers would have arrived. In 1947, a biologist named Thor Heyerdahl set out to prove the feasibility of such a trip. Along with five assistants, he built a balsa log raft (which he also named Kon-Tiki) and drifted 4,300 nautical miles from Callao in Peru to the Raroia atoll in Polynesia. The trip took three months and was quite treacherous, but it proved that it could be done. Heyerdahl&#8217;s book about his adventure quickly became a best-seller, reinforcing Tiki mania.</p>\n<p>In most parts of the United States, Tiki bars died out before disco. But in keeping with the modern &#8220;retro is good&#8221; meme, Tiki is experiencing a renaissance. I couldn&#8217;t be happier. I missed the Tiki fad the first time around, and of all the imaginary cultures I&#8217;ve experienced, Tiki is among my favorites. &#8212;<a href="http://joekissell.com/">Joe Kissell</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/245/tiki/">Permalink</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://itotd.com/send/245/">Email this Article</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Categories:</strong> <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Food%20and%20Drink">Food &amp; Drink</a>, <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Society%20and%20Culture">Society &amp; Culture</a></p>\n\t\t\t<h3>More Information about Tiki...</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>This article was featured in in <a href="http://www.urbanretrolifestyle.com/2006/06/21/retro-carnival-edition-1-june-21-2006/">Retro Carnival, Edition 1</a>.</p>\n<div><span style="float:left;margin-top:.2em;margin-right:1em;margin-bottom:0;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=itotd-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1891661302"><img src="http://rcm-images.amazon.com/images/P/1891661302.01.TZZZZZZZ" alt="cover art" style="border:0" /></a></span><p>A terrific overview of the history of Tiki culture by James Teitelbaum can be found in the online <a href="http://www.santamonicapress.com/catalog/tiki/body.html">introduction</a> to his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=itotd-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1891661302">Tiki Road Trip: A Guide to Tiki Culture in North America</a></em>.

If whatever crop you&#8217;re growing hasn&#8217;t been harvested by the time temperatures dip below freezing, serious damage can be done, right? Common sense, however, frequently turns out to be wrong. At least for grapes, freezing is eagerly anticipated by vintners in certain parts of the world. It&#8217;s a key factor in the production of an expensive variety of dessert wine known as <em>icewine</em>.</p>\n<p>Grapes are most comfortably grown in a Mediterranean climate&#8212;areas with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, such as France, Italy, Spain, Australia, and parts of California. But plenty of excellent wines also come from Germany, Austria, and the southeastern and southwestern corners of Canada, all places where freezing temperatures in winter are quite normal. And these are exactly the regions where icewine is produced.</p>\n<p><strong>Crushed Ice</strong><br />\nTo make icewine, you must wait until the grapes have frozen naturally on the vines&#8212;typically, you look for two solid days of temperatures in the range of 9&#00176;F (&#8211;13&#00176;C) to 14&#00176;F (&#8211;10&#00176;C). This implies a very late harvest, of course, which in turn means that the grapes will have a very high sugar content. Grapes are picked by hand (sometimes in the middle of the night to ensure that the temperature does not rise above freezing) and pressed <em>while still frozen</em>. This is the crucial step, because when frozen grapes are pressed, most of the water remains behind as ice crystals, and the juice obtained&#8212;just a drop or two per grape&#8212;is highly concentrated. (In fact, the colder the grapes, the higher the percentage of sugar in the juice, and this is exactly what you want for icewine&#8212;a minimum of 35% sugar.) This juice is then fermented naturally over a period of weeks or months and bottled more or less like regular wine. But because production is so labor-intensive, with yields around 10% of a regular harvest, icewine is sold in half bottles (375ml) at prices averaging about US$38 (CDN$50) per bottle.</p>\n<p>The smaller bottles are a good idea for another reason, too: icewine is very sweet (and usually high in alcohol, too), so it&#8217;s only consumed in very small quantities. What does it taste like? Imagine a sweet white wine, then imagine letting half the moisture evaporate away so that you have something not only sweeter but twice as viscous. That&#8217;s roughly the idea of icewine: it&#8217;s like a highly concentrated white wine. It&#8217;s always served chilled, usually with (or following) dessert.</p>\n<p><strong>Saving Grapes</strong><br />\nIcewine was discovered by accident in 1794 in Franconia (which is now part of Germany). After an early freeze, vintners decided to press the grapes anyway to see what could be salvaged. The unexpected result was an exceptionally sweet wine, dubbed <em>Eiswein</em>. It was several decades before icewine was produced intentionally in Germany, and production in North America didn&#8217;t begin until about 30 years ago. Production is always a bit risky since the vineyard is at the mercy of the weather; yields, quality, and price vary significantly from region to region and from year to year. Icewine has now become a bit of a fad and a status symbol&#8212;it&#8217;s what fashion-conscious wine snobs finish expensive meals with.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, wine snobs who have not already been sold on how hip icewine is supposed to be often don&#8217;t like it. A comment I&#8217;ve heard from more than a couple of people is, &#8220;Ewww. This isn&#8217;t good wine; it&#8217;s way too sweet.&#8221; But there are also people who believe a martini with more than a misting of vermouth is too sweet, or even that the quality of any alcoholic beverage is determined by its position on the dry-sweet continuum, with sweeter meaning less desirable. I have no such prejudice myself. Besides, icewine is in the same league as port, sherry, and perhaps even mead&#8212;it&#8217;s not something you would generally drink in large quantities along with a meal, but a small glass as a sweet digestif can be quite nice.</p>\n<p>Icewine is not that much different from any other late-harvest dessert wine, except in cost. But that&#8217;s not to say it isn&#8217;t worth a little extra, if only to compensate the grape pickers for freezing their buns off in the middle of the night for your drinking pleasure. &#8212;<a href="http://joekissell.com/">Joe Kissell</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/244/icewine/">Permalink</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://itotd.com/send/244/">Email this Article</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Categories:</strong> <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Clever%20Ideas">Clever Ideas</a>, <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Food%20and%20Drink">Food &amp; Drink</a></p>\n\t\t\t<h3>More Information about Icewine...</h3>\n\t\t\t<p><br />\n[[http://rcm-images.amazon.com/images/P/1894622138.01.TZZZZZZZ][http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=itotd-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1894622138][To learn more about icewine, read <a href="http://wine.about.com/library/types/bl_icewine.htm">this article</a> on About.com or pick up a copy of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=itotd-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/1894622138">Icewine: The Complete Story</a></em> by John Schreiner.

However, the city is by no means empty. For millions of residents and tourists, life goes on as usual, but there&#8217;s still that seasonal urge to spread out a towel on the sand and soak up some sun. Paris is nearly 125 miles (200km) from the coast, but every summer since 2002, a full-blown beach has appeared right in the center of town, courtesy of the city government and corporate sponsors.</p>\n<p>Paris Plages is the collective name of a series of sites set up around the city for summertime activities; they&#8217;re in operation for roughly a month each year from late July to late August. The idea was the brainchild of Paris mayor Bertrand Delano&#00235;, who has taken numerous steps to make the city more accessible to pedestrians and cyclists. The original and best-known Paris Plage is constructed along the right bank of the Seine River, running almost 2 miles (3km) from the Louvre to Pont Sully (the Sully Bridge). What is normally the Georges Pompidou Expressway is closed to traffic (much to the dismay of commuters) and turned into a pedestrian walkway. Along the side of the road farthest from the river the actual beaches are installed&#8212;3000 tons of sand trucked in and trucked back out every year. In between sections of faux beach are areas devoted to other activities for both adults and children, such as rock climbing, rollerblading, and even <a href="http://itotd.com/articles/272/tai-chi-chuan/">t&#8217;ai chi</a>. There are also restrooms, showers, first aid and police stations, and several mist zones where people can stand in a constant fine spray of water to cool off.</p>\n<p><strong>Summer Barbecue</strong><br />\nMostly, though, people do what they normally do on beaches: lie on the sand or in hammocks in their swimsuits and get sunburned. The crowds are often dense, and those who arrive late in the day, especially on weekends, may have trouble finding a spot. Unlike other crowded beaches, though, the one thing you will not see is people going in the water. Apart from the fact that the beach is separated from the river by a wall and a road, it&#8217;s not the sort of place you would want to swim, wade, or simply get your toes wet even if you could. It would be easier, safer, and probably more hygienic to take a dip directly in the <a href="http://itotd.com/articles/432/paris-sewers/">sewers</a>.</p>\n<p>However, if you go down the river a bit farther, you&#8217;ll find another Paris Plage location that features La Piscine Jos&#00233;phine Baker, a huge swimming pool that actually floats in a barge on the river. So you can swim in the river, in a manner of speaking, without risking your health. At other spots in the city you can enjoy everything from beach volleyball or rugby (in front of the H&#00244;tel de Ville, or City Hall, just steps from the central Paris Plage) to canoeing and kayaking (at the Bassin de la Villette).</p>\n<p><strong>Surf&#8217;s Up</strong><br />\nAnother thing you can do at any of the Paris Plage locations is, appropriately enough, surf&#8212;on the internet, that is. That&#8217;s right: the whole area has free Wi-Fi service. Which, I&#8217;m sure, was a very thoughtful and modern and generous notion on behalf of the organizers, but&#8230;seriously? I walked the entire length of the Paris Plage along the Seine and didn&#8217;t see a single laptop in use. Apart from the obvious fact that electronics don&#8217;t tend to get along well with sand, water, and bright sunlight, people really do go to the beach to relax. I&#8217;m teasing a bit: Wi-Fi is useful for numerous gadgets that are more beach-friendly, and there are certainly some dry, shady, and sand-free spots near the beach that would make a lovely spot to sit and type for a while if that&#8217;s your thing. But I know I wouldn&#8217;t choose a beach based on its internet connectivity.</p>\n<p>Well, for that matter, I pretty much wouldn&#8217;t choose a beach at all. My personal preference is to enjoy those nice sunny days and the beautiful scenery from the comfort of a cool, dark, and uncrowded room somewhere.

The Bohemian movement is in full swing. Revolutions in art and literature are brewing, technology is advancing rapidly, and more and more people are putting their creative efforts into the expansion of culture. You walk into a Paris caf&#00233; and see someone sitting at a corner table, scribbling or sketching madly, eyes fiery with enthusiasm. More than likely you see on the same table a glass containing a cloudy liquid&#8212;absinthe, the legendary &#8220;green muse&#8221; to which many artists of the day attribute their creative insights.</p>\n<p>Absinthe is among the most popular drinks around this time&#8212;not only in France but across Europe and even in the United States. But it is more than just a tasty alcoholic beverage: it&#8217;s a ritual. To prepare your absinthe in the traditional way, you begin by pouring about an ounce of the greenish liquid into a glass. On top of the glass you place a flat, slotted spoon on which a single sugar cube rests. You pour cold water over the sugar cube&#8212;slowly enough that it dissolves by the time your glass is full. As the water mixes with the clear liquid it turns cloudy&#8212;an effect called louching, caused by the oils in the absinthe. Finally, you stir the liquid with the spoon, and then drink. (A more theatrical variation on this ritual, performed by Johnny Depp&#8217;s character in the 2001 film &#8220;From Hell,&#8221; is to soak the sugar with absinthe first, and then set it on fire, allowing the heat to melt the sugar before you mix in the water.)</p>\n<p><strong>Absinthesis</strong><br />\nWhat you are drinking is a spirit made by distilling herbs. But that could describe many drinks; what makes absinthe special is the presence of a particular herb&#8212;<em>Artemisia absinthium</em>, commonly known as wormwood. This concoction was invented in 1792 by a French doctor named Pierre Ordinaire. While living in Switzerland, Ordinaire was trying to create a patent medicine to cure stomach ailments. He tried wormwood in one of his recipes&#8212;along with anise and a variety of other herbs&#8212;and found it very successful. Eventually the formula became commercialized, and absinthe began to shift from an over-the-counter remedy to a refreshing drink, acquiring the nickname &#8220;the Green Fairy.&#8221; Absinthe has a high alcohol content&#8212;nearly 70%&#8212;and a slightly bitter flavor. Adding water and sugar before drinking it worked wonders in improving its mass appeal.</p>\n<p>Unlike other alcoholic beverages, which have a sedative effect, absinthe was reputed to provide exceptional clarity of thought. Artists relied on it for inspiration and imagery. Among those who swore by absinthe were Van Gogh, Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, Picasso, Hemingway, and Edgar Allen Poe. Oscar Wilde was a fan too, and was famously quoted as saying: &#8220;After the first glass, you see things as you wish they were. After the second, you see things as they are not. Finally you see things as they really are, and that is the most horrible thing in the world.&#8221; Behind this wry commentary, though, was a troubling implication. An increasing number of people became convinced that absinthe was not a benign stimulant but a dangerous drug. Among those who drank absinthe excessively, there were numerous reports of hallucinations, convulsions, and even insanity.</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s Not Easy Being Green</strong><br />\nIn 1905, public anxiety came to a head when a Swiss farmer named Jean Lanfray shot his whole family. The newspapers were quick to point out that Lanfray had been drinking absinthe, not bothering to mention that he had also consumed a great deal of wine and other spirits that day. This was the final straw for those who vilified absinthe, and political pressure to rid society of this evil quickly mounted. In the years that followed, absinthe was banned in most parts of Europe, as well as in the United States.</p>\n<p>The deleterious effects of absinthe were typically attributed to a substance called thujone, a component of wormwood. Nowadays, scientists believe there&#8217;s little or no truth to the notion that it is a dangerous drug. Every modern study of thujone suggests that the amount required to harm human beings is many times that found in even the strongest brands of absinthe from a century ago. In fact, to ingest enough thujone to do any damage, you&#8217;d have to drink so much absinthe that you&#8217;d have died&#8212;or nearly so&#8212;from alcohol poisoning. Thus one common explanation for the disturbing behavior witnessed in absinthe drinkers is that <a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/04/sorry-absinthe.html">they were simply drunk</a>&#8212;a problem, for sure, but not one unique to absinthe. However, a more interesting explanation is based on evidence that unscrupulous absinthe producers in the nineteenth century, in an effort to lower their costs, added a variety of toxic chemicals to their absinthe&#8212;such as a copper compound used to provide a green color. The effect of these toxins&#8212;added to that of the alcohol itself&#8212;is a more plausible cause of the legendary absinthe madness.</p>\n<p><strong>The Glass is Greener on the Other Side of the Fence</strong><br />\nAll over the world, absinthe is enjoying a comeback, as the old laws prohibiting its manufacture and sale are being revised or at least reinterpreted. There have been two main legal sticking points over the years: thujone content and labeling. Both the United States and the European Union have long had rules requiring thujone levels in beverages of this sort to be less than 10 parts per million. (The U.S. Food and Drug Administration actually calls any beverage meeting that test &#8220;thujone-free.&#8221;) But that&#8217;s more or less a moot point, because most brands of absinthe sold in the 19th century were already within this limit&#8212;not that it matters much anyway, given the research that shows the thujone wasn&#8217;t the problem in the first place.</p>\n<p>A bigger issue is that regulatory agencies in some countries (including the U.S. and France) still don&#8217;t want anyone selling something that&#8217;s <em>called</em> absinthe, even if that&#8217;s precisely what it is, largely because of a perception that this word connotes a drug of some sort. So absinthe distillers have reached compromises with various government agencies such as using the word absinthe only as part of a phrase, or in smaller type, or otherwise adjusting the label to make it sound less like you&#8217;re going to be drinking something that&#8217;s likely to make you hallucinate.</p>\n<p>As a result of lengthy and expensive legal wrangling over a period of several years, in mid-2007 the United States finally began granting permission for genuine absinthe to be imported, manufactured, and sold. You can now buy brands such as <a href="http://drinklucid.com/">Lucid</a> (made in France), <a href="http://www.kublerabsinthe.com/">K&#00252;bler</a> (made in Switzerland), and <a href="http://www.stgeorgespirits.com/AbsintheVerteMovie.htm">St. George</a> (the first brand to be made legally in the U.S. since 1912). In Europe, many brands and formulations are available, with some trying to get as close as possible to the original taste, and others going in more trendy directions. (You can even find red, blue, and clear absinthe.)</p>\n<p><strong>Absinthe Makes the Heart Grow Fonder</strong><br />\nCanada, meanwhile, never bothered to restrict the sale of absinthe because it was never perceived to be a social or political problem there. I had my first encounter with the Green Fairy while I was living in Canada several years ago, when absinthe was still unavailable in the U.S. I experienced a subtle, but noticeable, increase in the clarity and vividness of my thoughts shortly after drinking absinthe&#8212;a much different effect than I&#8217;d have expected from alcohol alone. Then again, I couldn&#8217;t say with complete certainty that the effect was not imagined, and there was an additional complication: the uncertain authenticity of the formula.</p>\n<p>The only brand of absinthe commercially available in Canada at that time was Hill&#8217;s Absinth, made in the Czech Republic. Absinthe experts roundly dismiss Hill&#8217;s as undrinkable&#8212;a pale imitation of real absinthe. Personally, I quite liked it&#8212;but then, I had no experience with other varieties to serve as a frame of reference. (I also found it mildly ironic that detractors should use the word &#8220;undrinkable&#8221; because that is exactly the definition of the Greek word from which the name absinthe is derived.)</p>\n<p>I moved to France in 2007, right around the time legal absinthes were starting to appear in the U.S. I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of sampling quite a few varieties of authentic absinthe here. It&#8217;s easy to find bars in Paris with wide selections of absinthe on the shelves, and there&#8217;s even a little shop called <a href="http://www.vertdabsinthe.com/">Vert d&#8217;Absinthe</a> that sells only absinthe and related paraphernalia. To be honest, although I&#8217;ve enjoyed every absinthe I&#8217;ve tried, my unsophisticated palate sometimes has difficulty differentiating the taste of absinthe from that of <a href="http://itotd.com/articles/248/pastis">pastis</a>, a similar (but wormwood-free) anise-based distilled beverage that rose to popularity when absinthe was banned. (During the time when absinthe was legally unavailable, numerous companies began producing pastis with names suggestive of absinthe&#8212;brands like Absente, Versinthe, and La Muse Verte.) I can&#8217;t say the absinthe I&#8217;ve had here has made me more creative or clear-headed, but perhaps I simply haven&#8217;t been diligent enough in my experimentation. I&#8217;ll press on. &#8212;<a href="http://joekissell.com/">Joe Kissell</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/243/absinthe/">Permalink</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://itotd.com/send/243/">Email this Article</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Categories:</strong> <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Food%20and%20Drink">Food &amp; Drink</a>, <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/History">History</a></p>\n\t\t\t<h3>More Information about Absinthe...</h3>\n\t\t\t<p><br />\nThere are plenty of absinthe resources on the Web.

I haven&#8217;t experienced that smell&#8212;either from its original source or elsewhere&#8212;in well over a decade, but the memory of being back at my grandmother&#8217;s house was immediate and striking. On the other hand, I can&#8217;t really remember or recreate that smell in my mind; either it&#8217;s there or it isn&#8217;t. I have convenient analog and digital methods of recording images and sounds so that I can see and hear them later, but no way to capture the scent of a dish at a restaurant, a favorite vacation spot, or any other smell that moves me in some way.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t normally think of smelling as being something within the province of machines. I understand, of course, that devices like smoke detectors and breathalyzers perform what amounts to mechanical olfaction of sorts, but I was still sort of surprised to learn that increasingly sophisticated artificial noses are being incorporated into robots and other devices. What intrigues me more than anything is how such sensors might work. How does one go about measuring and quantifying something as broad and seemingly subjective as smell?</p>\n<p><strong>Name That Smell</strong><br />\nAll smells result from molecules of various chemicals floating through the air. Not all substances have a smell&#8212;only those containing chemicals that are volatile (meaning they evaporate easily). Our nasal cavities contain millions of neural receptors, of about 350 different types&#8212;all of which respond to different chemicals. Depending on which chemicals are present and in what quantities, different sets of odorant receptor neurons are activated; the brain decodes each pattern and assigns a meaning to it: &#8220;floral,&#8221; &#8220;putrid,&#8221; &#8220;Grandma&#8217;s house,&#8221; or whatever. Therefore, getting a machine to do the same thing involves two challenges: detecting individual chemical components, and figuring out what a specific combination of components in a given proportion represents.</p>\n<p>One way to detect chemicals in the air is to use large, expensive laboratory machines such as gas chromatographs and time-of-flight mass spectrometers. These devices can very accurately detect miniscule amounts of volatile chemicals in air samples&#8212;but they also detect substances that have nothing to do with smell, so determining just which parts of their output are relevant adds more complexity to the problem. They are also, so far at least, not very portable. But other, more direct&#8212;and more compact&#8212;methods of artificial smell detection are under development. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor is a tiny device that can detect a single, arbitrary chemical. This sensor consists of a quartz crystal vibrating at a known frequency. It&#8217;s coated with a material that can absorb molecules only of a very specific size and shape. When it does, its mass increases slightly, changing the frequency of the crystal&#8217;s vibration. A simple circuit detects the change and signals that the chemical in question is present. Given an array of QCM sensors, each with a coating that responds to a different chemical, you can detect a wide range of smells.</li>\n<li>A variation on this idea under development by IBM in Z&#00252;rich is the cantilever sensor: a series of flexible, microscopic silicon beams&#8212;each coated with a different polymer. When one of the beams absorbs a specific chemical, it bends slightly; the chip to which the beams are attached detects this change.</li>\n<li>An entirely different approach being studied at the University of Illinois involves using vapor-sensitive dyes called metalloporphyrins that change color when exposed to certain chemicals. By examining the &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221; states of an array of these dyes, a computer can essentially &#8220;see&#8221; smells.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Decoding output from an array of sensors (of whatever sort) is an interesting challenge, because substances that are very similar chemically sometimes smell much different from each other; conversely, substances that smell nearly the same can be completely different at the molecular level. For this task, researchers often rely on neural networks, software that can be trained to identify patterns and make educated guesses about new combinations based on their similarities to patterns that have already been verified.</p>\n<p>So where is all this technology going to be put to use? And what about those robots? </p>\n<p><strong>Follow Your Nose</strong><br />\nArtificial noses show the most promise in applications where the human nose is insufficiently sensitive or discriminating. For example, sensors could detect when food is spoiled long before a human nose could&#8212;an artificial nose may be built into your refrigerator one day. Just as the bacteria that cause spoilage produce distinctive odors, so do some disease-causing bacteria. Devices now in development will be able to diagnose certain illnesses by smelling blood samples.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s one thing to be able to identify an odor in a test tube; it&#8217;s another to be able to trace the source of an airborne scent. This is where robots come in: a mobile platform with an artificial nose can continuously sample the air, reorienting itself dynamically to move in the direction where an odor is strongest. This makes robots that can smell ideal for locating gas leaks, explosives, drugs, and other dangerous stuff&#8212;since robots can go places where it would be unsafe to send a human or a dog. One rather gruesome use for sniffing robots is locating buried bodies; this is but one of many possible forensic applications. A mechanical bloodhound may be years in the future, but it&#8217;s not at all far-fetched.</p>\n<p><strong>If You Could Bottle This Smell&#8230;</strong><br />\nSeveral years ago a company called DigiScents made headlines with its iSmell device, a desktop computer peripheral that could synthesize thousands of scents. Their idea was that games could be enhanced with smells (presumably lots of smoke and burnt rubber), email from that special someone could be scented with perfume, and so on. When DigiScents went out of business in 2001 before the iSmell became commercially available, no one was particularly surprised&#8212;why do we need to smell computer games, anyway? But I think the real problem was that they only had half of the solution ready: the output but no input. I suspect that if someone created a pocket-sized gadget that could record the scent of a bakery, garden, or any other  smell you encounter and play it back accurately on command, it would be a huge success.

{'title': 'Hikaru Dorodango / Mud balls as art', 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/InterestingThingOfTheDay/~3/hhHTLv27pNc/r2', 'author': 'Joe Kissell', 'date': '2017.04.07', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/InterestingThingOfTheDay', 'value': '<p>Children, I have observed, seem to have an innate affinity for dirt. No matter how recently a parent has dressed the child in freshly laundered clothes, no matter how carefully the parent has attempted to keep the child geographically separated from any substance that might soil or stain, it is just not possible to keep a child clean for more than 60 seconds. I use the word &#8220;affinity&#8221; advisedly, because it implies not merely a liking, a preference, but a chemical attraction. Kids clearly have a talent for finding dirt, but also, dirt finds them. If you&#8217;re a parent, you know what I&#8217;m talking about. Eventually, having spent a sum equivalent to your monthly grocery budget on moist towelettes, you give up on keeping the child perpetually clean and set a new, lower but potentially reachable standard of not-entirely-covered-with-mud.</p>\n<p>Mud, of course, is that particular species of dirt that children seem to find most fascinating (and which apparently finds them fascinating as well). As far as kids are concerned, mud is cool because it&#8217;s gooey and squishy and feels neat and adheres very effectively to your sister&#8217;s dress when flung from across the yard. Grown-ups find mud icky for exactly the same reasons, and <em>dried</em> mud, well, that&#8217;s somehow an even greater insult to cleanliness&#8212;it&#8217;s just so&#8230;unsightly. Among the words not commonly associated with mud are smooth, shiny, and beautiful. But that&#8217;s changing now, thanks to the renaissance of a traditional Japanese art form known as <em><a href="http://www.dorodango.com/">dorodango</a></em>, shiny mud balls (or, more specifically, <em>hikaru dorodango</em>, ultra-glossy mud balls). Parents are now not only actively encouraging their kids to play in the mud, they&#8217;re getting their own hands dirty too as they spend hours refining ordinary dirt into elegant sculptures.</p>\n<p><strong>Putting the Shine On</strong><br />\nIt seems odd to think of mud as something that could become shiny or even smooth. Polished rocks are one thing, but mud wouldn&#8217;t seem to be hard enough or dense enough to be polished. With the right technique and a lot of patience, however, it can be.</p>\n<p>The full procedure has numerous important details, but essentially the idea is this. You start with a lump of mud, squeeze most of the water out of it, and slowly and gently add layers of ever-finer dry dirt on top, all the while shaping into as perfect a sphere as you can and smoothing off any rough spots or irregularities. Over a period of hours, as the ball dries and you continue refining the surface, a hard shell (or &#8220;capsule&#8221;) forms on the outside. If you&#8217;ve executed the procedure just so and timed it correctly, this surface can be buffed to a high gloss with an ordinary rag.</p>\n<p>The result should be an orb about the size of a billiard ball, and just as shiny; its color depends on the kind of soil used, but can vary from nearly white, through yellow, red, and brown, to nearly black, with subtle shadings that make it look more like a fine marble carving than what was recently a mixture of dirt and water.</p>\n<p><strong>Having a Ball</strong><br />\nIn the past several years, the art of dorodango has enjoyed a surge in popularity&#8212;first in Japan, and more recently in the United States. The renewed interest is largely due to the work of a developmental psychologist at the Kyoto University of Education named Fumio Kayo. Kayo developed a simple method of making dorodango that could be taught even to young children, and besides keeping them occupied quietly for long periods of time, this activity enabled Kayo to study aspects of children&#8217;s play that had gone largely unnoticed, and which have interesting implications for his academic work. One of Kayo&#8217;s most striking observations was that children invariably become deeply attached to the mud balls they&#8217;ve spent so many hours creating, even if they&#8217;re misshapen or otherwise flawed. (Not a surprise to me: I knew that kids get attached to mud, or vice-versa.) Adults who have tried the procedure have reported similar feelings.</p>\n<p>Children who spend their afternoons making dorodango do, I&#8217;m afraid, end up with dirty hands and clothes. But they also have a stunning work of art to show for it, and that&#8217;s got to count for something. I have yet to try dorodango myself, but I love the idea that you can make something so beautiful with three ingredients (dirt, water, and a rag) that virtually anyone in the world can obtain for free. As any child knows, mud is one of life&#8217;s simple pleasures. &#8212;<a href="http://joekissell.com/">Joe Kissell</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/646/hikaru-dorodango/">Permalink</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://itotd.com/send/646/">Email this Article</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Categories:</strong> <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Clever%20Ideas">Clever Ideas</a>, <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Society%20and%20Culture">Society &amp; Culture</a>, <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Sports%20and%20Recreation">Sports &amp; Recreation</a></p>\n\t\t\t<h3>More Information about Hikaru Dorodango...</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>Thanks to reader Bruce Gardner for suggesting today&#8217;s topic!

{'title': 'Cow Sharing / Getting the milk for free', 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/InterestingThingOfTheDay/~3/GCkKgNt5HrY/r2', 'author': 'Morgen Jahnke', 'date': '2017.04.05', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/InterestingThingOfTheDay', 'value': '<h4 style="background-color:transparent;color:#008000;font-style:italic">by Morgen Jahnke</h4>\n\t\t\t<p>Humans have been raising cows and drinking their milk for thousands of years, and for most of that time there was only one form that the milk came in: straight from the cow. Different cultures developed ways of transforming that milk into other foods, from yogurt to cheese to butter, but the original liquid stayed the same.</p>\n<p>However, when you visit an average supermarket in Europe or North America these days, you are faced with a plethora of choices in the milk aisle. You can have your milk homogenized, that is with the butterfat distributed throughout the milk, or you can buy only the cream skimmed from the top. You can have it in a low-fat or high-fat form, and you can buy it with part of the lactose removed for those who are lactose-intolerant.</p>\n<p>Despite all these choices, there is one type of milk that you will be unlikely to find: raw, unpasteurized milk, or the kind that comes straight from the cow. It is now the standard for milk commercially sold to be pasteurized&#8212;heated to a high temperature to destroy pathogens&#8212;and in some cases, particularly in Europe, it may even undergo <a href="http://itotd.com/articles/220/milk-in-a-box/">UHT</a> (Ultra High Temperature) pasteurization. In fact, many states in the U.S. and governments in other countries do not allow the sale of milk that hasn&#8217;t been pasteurized, citing public health concerns. In response to this, consumers who prefer raw, unpasteurized milk have found a novel way to obtain it: through the practice of cow sharing.</p>\n<p><strong>A Raw Deal</strong><br />\nCow sharing, although different in many ways from <a href="http://itotd.com/articles/329/car-sharing-programs/">car sharing</a>, has some of the same principles. A group shares the benefits of a car or a cow without having individual responsibility for it. Cow sharing can take many different forms, but it usually involves a farmer selling &#8220;shares&#8221; in a cow, and as a kind of dividend, shareholders receive fresh milk at regular intervals. Many of these arrangements also require shareholders to pay additional fees for the upkeep of the cow&#8212;for its feeding, housing, and milking. The number of shares per cow varies; it is often dependent upon how much milk the cow can produce, and how much of that milk is tied to each share.</p>\n<p>In areas where the sale of raw milk is prohibited, cow sharing can be a legal way for people to obtain it. There is usually no prohibition on dairy farmers consuming raw milk themselves, since they are not selling it, and in the same way, shareholders are not buying milk, but are owners along with the farmer. Even in areas where the sale of raw milk is allowed, cow sharing appeals to people who want a more direct connection with the source of their food.</p>\n<p>And why is raw milk in such demand? Raw milk proponents claim that the process of pasteurization kills not only unhealthy organisms, but destroys beneficial enzymes and vitamins present in milk&#8217;s natural state. Some also argue that the pasteurization requirement favors large-scale dairy operations over small farms that would benefit from being able to sell directly to the public. Others are drawn to raw milk because of its versatility; they want to make their own butter or cheese, which isn&#8217;t possible with highly processed milk. Some simply think it tastes better.</p>\n<p><strong>The Heat is On</strong><br />\nAs passionately as raw milk proponents feel about the issue, there are similar strong feelings on the other side. Opponents of the consumption of raw milk point to statistics showing that it has caused outbreaks of <em>E. coli</em> and other food-borne illnesses, and argue that pasteurization is necessary to protect the public from these types of outbreaks. Several cases in recent years have highlighted the divisiveness of this issue, including that of Michael Schmidt, a dairy farmer in the Canadian province of Ontario. Schmidt, who runs a cow sharing operation, had his property seized in November 2006 and was charged with operating a milk plant without a license. His case gained a lot of attention when he went on a month-long hunger strike (broken only by a glass of raw milk daily) to protest the charges.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, both sides in this controversy have valid points; it is important to maintain public safety when it comes to food products, but if people decide they still want to drink raw milk after hearing about its potential health risks, I don&#8217;t think they should be prevented from doing that. As for me, I can only be a bystander to this debate since I am lactose-intolerant; is there such a thing as raw soy milk? &#8212;<a href="http://spectatrix.com/">Morgen Jahnke</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/645/cow-sharing/">Permalink</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://itotd.com/send/645/">Email this Article</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Categories:</strong> <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Clever%20Ideas">Clever Ideas</a>, <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Food%20and%20Drink">Food &amp; Drink</a>, <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Science%20and%20Nature">Science &amp; Nature</a></p>\n\t\t\t<h3>More Information about Cow Sharing...</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>The Web site for <a href="http://www.realmilk.com/cowfarmshare.html">A Campaign for Real Milk</a> provides information about the benefits of raw milk, where it is available, and how cow sharing arrangements work.</p>\n<p>Articles about Michael Schmidt&#8217;s case can be found on the <a href="http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/editorialsletters/story.html?id=fd609585-98e6-4374-b4b9-b4827a81d4bd">National Post Web site</a>, the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/ottawa/story/2007/01/15/milk.html">CBC News site</a>, and on the <a href="http://www.realmilk.com/real-milk-canada.html">Real Milk Web site</a>.</p>\n<p>Popular food blogger Pim Techamuanvivit writes about her cow sharing experience on <a href="http://chezpim.typepad.com/blogs/2007/07/how-i-went-to-d.html">Chez Pim</a>.</p>\n<p>A <a href="http://www.wtop.com/?nid=598&amp;sid=1192941">Maryland court case</a> about cow sharing went to trial in July 2007.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-08-06-raw-milk-usat_x.htm">USA Today</a> looked at cow sharing in August 2006.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4230005">NPR</a> ran a story about cow sharing in December 2004.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<h3>Related Articles from Interesting Thing of the Day</h3>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/220/milk-in-a-box/">Milk in a Box</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/329/car-sharing-programs/">Car Sharing Programs</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t<li><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/517/kefir/">Kefir</a></li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t<p class="copyright">&#x2117; &amp; &#xA9; 2007, <a href="http://alt.cc/">alt concepts</a>.

I was one of only four or five philosophy majors in my class, and most of my friends simply couldn&#8217;t comprehend why I chose such a field. For one thing, philosophy was obviously the most boring subject in the world, and for another, there didn&#8217;t seem to be anything you could <em>do</em> with a degree in philosophy. My classmates would say things like, &#8220;I&#8217;m majoring in psychology, which means I can become a psychologist. I can have an office and an ad in the yellow pages and people will pay to come talk to me. But there aren&#8217;t any philosophers in the yellow pages&#8212;look it up. How do you expect to earn a living as a philosopher?&#8221; I had no good answer to that question. I didn&#8217;t think I wanted to teach philosophy, which is the usual way philosophers make money. But I wasn&#8217;t worried about long-term career options or marketability. All I knew was that of all the subjects I&#8217;d studied in the past two years, philosophy was the only one that interested me enough to take seriously. It seemed important in a way that, say, history or even science did not&#8212;it was a search for answers to the Big Questions: Is there a God? What is the nature of existence? What does it mean to be human? How do we determine right and wrong? I couldn&#8217;t imagine wasting my time on lesser questions.</p>\n<p>It was not long, of course, before we began talking about Descartes, who in the early 17th century famously said, &#8220;I think, therefore I am.&#8221; This was not an idle comment; Descartes was looking for a starting point for his philosophical inquiries, some basic principle that, no matter what, could not be doubted. He decided to start by tossing out any belief that could conceivably&#8212;even under the unlikeliest conditions&#8212;be doubted. For Descartes, it was impossible to doubt his own existence. One could be mistaken about the interpretation of sensory data, but not, he felt, about the experience of thinking.</p>\n<p><strong>Putting Descartes Before da Husserl</strong> (sorry)<br />\nDescartes has been extremely influential in the study of philosophy ever since, and though he has as many detractors as fans, there has never been a satisfactory resolution to that seed of doubt he planted: Just what sorts of information can we trust? People frequently believe things that are not true, for any number of reasons. One of the tasks of philosophy is to figure out what kinds of things exist out there in the world. But is that even knowable? Can we trust our senses to give us an accurate representation of the world&#8212;especially when we all know that scientific facts often contradict the common-sense interpretations of our experience?</p>\n<p>Almost three centuries later, in the early 1900s, a German philosopher named Edmund Husserl found himself worrying about just these kinds of questions. He felt that a lot of philosophy was entirely too subjective, that philosophers took too much for granted about the way the world works. Husserl began developing a method of philosophical inquiry that would be immune to the hermeneutical baggage that prevented true objectivity. In his 1913 book <em>Ideas Pertaining to a Pure Phenomenology and to a Phenomenological Philosophy</em> he first used the word <em>phenomenology</em> to describe this new way of philosophical investigation.</p>\n<p><strong>Experiencing Phenomenology</strong><br />\nPhenomenology is not an easy subject to get your brain around, even if you studied it in college and grad school, even if you wrote your Master&#8217;s thesis on it. (Just speaking hypothetically here, of course.) For example, as I was skimming through half a dozen books and innumerable Web sites to collect background information for this article, I was repeatedly struck by the complete absence of any definition of the term that is both concise and useful. Among the definitions of phenomenology you may encounter are &#8220;the science of experience,&#8221; &#8220;the study of apparent phenomena,&#8221; and &#8220;the systematic description of pre-theoretical experience.&#8221; Great, so&#8230;what is it? Those definitions are concise, all right, but they don&#8217;t tell you a whole lot.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, phenomenology is an attempt to study experience itself objectively and scientifically. That may seem contradictory&#8212;isn&#8217;t experience, by its very nature, subjective? Husserl was looking for a rigorous method of describing experience that in fact did away with subjectivity. His motto was, &#8220;To the things themselves!&#8221; By this he did not mean that he wanted to study things as they exist objectively out there in the world, but rather that he wanted to study the <em>experience</em> of things&#8212;as they present themselves to the observer&#8212;without any assumptions, predefinitions, interpretations, or prejudice as to why or how they exist (or even whether they &#8220;really&#8221; exist at all).</p>\n<p><strong>Bracket This</strong><br />\nThe phenomenological method is involved and time-consuming, but here&#8217;s a brief outline. The first step is to consider the memory of a very recent experience&#8212;phenomenology is not normally done in real time&#8212;and subject it to a process known variously as <em>epoch&#00233;</em>, bracketing, or phenomenological reduction. Much like the Cartesian method of doubt, epoch&#00233; is a temporary suspension of any external beliefs, placing one&#8217;s focus solely on the &#8220;raw&#8221; experience itself. The goal is to ignore empirical data&#8212;along with intuitions and judgments&#8212;and simply describe your experience in detail. To take a fairly trivial example, a phenomenological description of eating ice cream would not include a list of ingredients, information about fat and calories, or the likely impact on one&#8217;s waistline. Instead, your description includes details about the flavor, temperature, texture, color, and so on. In other words, you don&#8217;t concern yourself with <em>what</em> appears, but rather, with a thing&#8217;s <em>way</em> of appearing.</p>\n<p>After this, you perform a further process known as <em>eidetic reduction</em>. This involves taking certain features of the bracketed experience and imagining variations on them, as freely as you can. For example, if I am focusing on how a cup appears to me, I may perform free variation on the feature <em>color</em>, changing it to different hues, or attempting to remove the feature completely. The purpose of this exercise is to arrive at the features that are essential to the object in question. Thus I should discover, for example, that while no one particular color is essential to a cup&#8217;s being a cup, it <em>is</em> essential that it have <em>some</em> color. This is an essential feature of a cup <em>in my experience</em>; whether someone else would find it so is not for me to say. But the phenomenologist hopes to learn, in this way, how to describe any experience with complete objectivity. </p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;ll Drive You to Drink</strong><br />\nHusserl&#8217;s phenomenological method changed significantly over the years, and other philosophers have taken it in very different directions. Martin Heidegger, for example, who was both a student and a critic of Husserl, doubted whether the epoch&#00233; was useful or even possible, while still rigidly adhering to the &#8220;describe, don&#8217;t explain&#8221; model of inquiry. Other famous phenomenologists have included Jean-Paul Sartre, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Paul Ricoeur, all of whom put their own spin on Husserl&#8217;s basic principles. Besides being an independent branch of philosophy, phenomenology is applied with increasing regularity to other fields, including science, literature, and the arts. But it&#8217;s also becoming excessively trendy&#8212;you may hear something like &#8220;the phenomenology of consumer-oriented marketing,&#8221; which means, approximately, nothing. But I can&#8217;t complain too much. At least now if someone asks me what I plan to do with my degree in philosophy, I can say, &#8220;phenomenological obfuscation.&#8221; &#8212;<a href="http://joekissell.com/">Joe Kissell</a></p>\n\n\t\t\t<p><a href="http://itotd.com/articles/237/phenomenology/">Permalink</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="http://itotd.com/send/237/">Email this Article</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<strong>Category:</strong> <a href="http://itotd.com/categories/Philosophy%20and%20Religion">Philosophy &amp; Religion</a></p>\n\t\t\t<h3>More Information about Phenomenology...</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>This article was featured in <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/ethicsandscience/2006/07/philosophers_carnival_32.php">Philosophers&#8217; Carnival #32</a>.</p>\n<div><span style="float:left;margin-top:.2em;margin-right:1em;margin-bottom:0;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=itotd-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0415183731"><img src="http://rcm-images.amazon.com/images/P/0415183731.01.TZZZZZZZ" alt="cover art" style="border:0" /></a></span><p>For a good introduction to phenomenology, try <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=itotd-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0415183731">Introduction to Phenomenology</a></em> by Dermot Moran or (a different) <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=itotd-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0521667925">Introduction to Phenomenology</a></em> by Robert Sokolowski.</p></div><div style="clear:both"></div>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a real glutton for punishment, you can read English translations of Husserl&#8212;but I warn you, this is very dense stuff.
